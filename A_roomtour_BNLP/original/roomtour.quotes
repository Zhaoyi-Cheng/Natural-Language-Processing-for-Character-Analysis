187	189	226	228	Miss Charlotte Bartlett	128	“ S ”
366	376	378	379	Miss Bartlett	128	“ The Signora had no business to do it , ”
381	421	378	379	Miss Bartlett	128	“ no business at all . She promised us south rooms with a view close together , instead of which here are north rooms , looking into a courtyard , and a long way apart . Oh , Lucy ! ”
422	429	431	431	Lucy	129	“ And a Cockney , besides ! ”
445	451	452	452	She	129	“ It might be London . ”
538	579	674	674	she	129	“ Charlotte , do n’t you feel , too , that we might be in London ? I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside . I suppose it is one ’s being so tired . ”
580	590	592	593	Miss Bartlett	128	“ This meat has surely been used for soup , ”
600	643	674	674	she	129	“ I want so to see the Arno . The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno . The Signora had no business to do it at all . Oh , it is a shame ! ”
644	651	652	653	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Any nook does for me , ”
656	670	652	653	Miss Bartlett	128	“ but it does seem hard that you should n’t have a view . ”
679	712	674	674	she	129	“ Charlotte , you must n’t spoil me : of course , you must look over the Arno , too . I meant that . The first vacant room in the front — ”
713	719	721	722	Miss Bartlett	128	“ You must have it , ”
749	759	674	674	she	129	“ No , no . You must have it . ”
760	775	721	722	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I insist on it . Your mother would never forgive me , Lucy . ”
776	783	674	674	she	129	“ She would never forgive me . ”
857	868	854	854	He	351	“ I have a view , I have a view . ”
899	901	910	911	the intruder	356	“ do ”
1020	1035	1005	1005	she	128	“ A view ? Oh , a view ! How delightful a view is ! ”
1036	1042	1044	1046	the old man	360	“ This is my son , ”
1048	1060	1044	1046	the old man	360	“ his name ’s George . He has a view too . ”
1061	1064	1066	1067	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Ah , ”
1078	1083	1084	1084	he	356	“ What I mean , ”
1087	1106	1084	1084	he	356	“ is that you can have our rooms , and we ’ll have yours . We ’ll change . ”
1141	1155	1132	1132	her	128	“ Thank you very much indeed ; that is out of the question . ”
1156	1159	1161	1163	the old man	360	“ Why ? ”
1172	1185	1132	1132	her	128	“ Because it is quite out of the question , thank you . ”
1186	1197	1199	1199	Lucy	129	“ You see , we do n’t like to take — ”
1207	1211	1212	1212	he	356	“ But why ? ”
1215	1227	1229	1229	he	356	“ Women like looking at a view ; men do n’t . ”
1247	1253	1229	1229	he	356	“ George , persuade them ! ”
1254	1265	1267	1268	the son	367	“ It ’s so obvious they should have the rooms , ”
1270	1278	1267	1268	the son	367	“ There ’s nothing else to say . ”
1317	1322	1306	1306	she	129	“ quite a scene , ”
1445	1452	1436	1436	She	128	“ Are you all like this ? ”
1482	1491	1436	1436	She	128	“ We are not ; we are genteel . ”
1492	1499	1500	1500	she	128	“ Eat your dinner , dear , ”
1529	1551	1500	1500	she	128	“ Eat your dinner , dear . This pension is a failure . To - morrow we will make a change . ”
1618	1653	1600	1600	Lucy	129	“ Oh , oh ! Why , it ’s Mr. Beebe ! Oh , how perfectly lovely ! Oh , Charlotte , we must stop now , however bad the rooms are . Oh ! ”
1662	1704	1654	1655	Miss Bartlett	128	“ How do you do , Mr. Beebe ? I expect that you have forgotten us : Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch , who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter ’s that very cold Easter . ”
1749	1758	1760	1770	the girl , who was in a state of spiritual starvation	377	“ I am so glad to see you , ”
1788	1808	1760	1770	the girl , who was in a state of spiritual starvation	377	“ Just fancy how small the world is . Summer Street , too , makes it so specially funny . ”
1809	1820	1822	1823	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street , ”
1830	1850	1822	1823	Miss Bartlett	128	“ and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living — ”
1851	1891	1760	1770	the girl , who was in a state of spiritual starvation	377	“ Yes , I heard from mother so last week . She did n’t know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells ; but I wrote back at once , and I said : ‘ Mr. Beebe is — ’ ”
1892	1896	1898	1899	the clergyman	380	“ Quite right , ”
1901	1925	1898	1899	the clergyman	380	“ I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June . I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood . ”
1926	1943	2025	2026	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Oh , how glad I am ! The name of our house is Windy Corner . ”
1948	1982	2025	2026	Miss Bartlett	128	“ There is mother and me generally , and my brother , though it ’s not often we get him to ch — — The church is rather far off , I mean . ”
1983	1995	2025	2026	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Lucy , dearest , let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner . ”
1996	2009	2010	2010	He	133	“ I am eating it , thank you , and enjoying it . ”
2074	2082	2083	2083	his	133	“ Do n’t neglect the country round , ”
2087	2108	2083	2083	his	133	“ The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole , and round by Settignano , or something of that sort . ”
2109	2112	2083	2083	his	133	“ No ! ”
2123	2142	2083	2083	his	133	“ Mr. Beebe , you are wrong . The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato . ”
2143	2150	2152	2153	Miss Bartlett	128	“ That lady looks so clever , ”
2158	2164	2152	2153	Miss Bartlett	128	“ We are in luck . ”
2263	2299	2257	2259	the clever lady	392	“ Prato ! They must go to Prato . That place is too sweetly squalid for words . I love it ; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability , as you know . ”
2583	2591	2592	2592	she	128	“ We are most grateful to you , ”
2596	2617	2592	2592	she	128	“ The first evening means so much . When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart d’heure . ”
2623	2645	2680	2680	He	133	“ Do you , by any chance , know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner ? ”
2646	2649	2680	2680	He	133	“ Emerson . ”
2650	2658	2680	2680	He	133	“ Is he a friend of yours ? ”
2659	2670	2680	2680	He	133	“ We are friendly — as one is in pensions . ”
2671	2679	2680	2680	He	133	“ Then I will say no more . ”
2691	2699	2700	2700	she	128	“ I am , as it were , ”
2703	2749	2700	2700	she	128	“ the chaperon of my young cousin , Lucy , and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing . His manner was somewhat unfortunate . I hope I acted for the best . ”
2750	2756	2758	2758	he	133	“ You acted very naturally , ”
2771	2788	2760	2760	He	133	“ All the same , I do n’t think much harm would have come of accepting . ”
2789	2805	2700	2700	she	128	“ No harm , of course . But we could not be under an obligation . ”
2806	2814	2816	2816	he	133	“ He is rather a peculiar man . ”
2824	2914	2816	2816	he	133	“ I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance , nor expect you to show gratitude . He has the merit — if it is one — of saying exactly what he means . He has rooms he does not value , and he thinks you would value them . He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite . It is so difficult — at least , I find it difficult — to understand people who speak the truth . ”
2922	2942	2915	2915	Lucy	129	“ I was hoping that he was nice ; I do so always hope that people will be nice . ”
2943	3059	2700	2700	she	128	“ I think he is ; nice and tiresome . I differ from him on almost every point of any importance , and so , I expect — I may say I hope — you will differ . But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores . When he first came here he not unnaturally put people ’s backs up . He has no tact and no manners — I do n’t mean by that that he has bad manners — and he will not keep his opinions to himself . We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora , but I am glad to say we thought better of it . ”
3060	3066	3068	3069	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Am I to conclude , ”
3071	3078	3068	3069	Miss Bartlett	128	“ that he is a Socialist ? ”
3095	3111	2700	2700	she	128	“ And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist , too ? ”
3112	3166	2700	2700	she	128	“ I hardly know George , for he has n’t learnt to talk yet . He seems a nice creature , and I think he has brains . Of course , he has all his father ’s mannerisms , and it is quite possible that he , too , may be a Socialist . ”
3167	3174	3176	3177	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Oh , you relieve me , ”
3179	3202	3176	3177	Miss Bartlett	128	“ So you think I ought to have accepted their offer ? You feel I have been narrow - minded and suspicious ? ”
3203	3208	3209	3209	he	410	“ Not at all , ”
3212	3218	3209	3209	he	410	“ I never suggested that . ”
3219	3236	3176	3177	Miss Bartlett	128	“ But ought I not to apologize , at all events , for my apparent rudeness ? ”
3265	3271	3273	3274	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Was I a bore ? ”
3283	3328	3273	3274	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Why did n’t you talk , Lucy ? He prefers young people , I ’m sure . I do hope I have n’t monopolized him . I hoped you would have him all the evening , as well as all dinner - time . ”
3329	3334	3336	3336	Lucy	129	“ He is nice , ”
3338	3361	3336	3336	Lucy	129	“ Just what I remember . He seems to see good in everyone . No one would take him for a clergyman . ”
3362	3367	3273	3274	Miss Bartlett	128	“ My dear Lucia — ”
3368	3394	3336	3336	Lucy	129	“ Well , you know what I mean . And you know how clergymen generally laugh ; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man . ”
3395	3418	3273	3274	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Funny girl ! How you do remind me of your mother . I wonder if she will approve of Mr. Beebe . ”
3419	3431	3336	3336	Lucy	129	“ I ’m sure she will ; and so will Freddy . ”
3432	3464	3273	3274	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve ; it is the fashionable world . I am used to Tunbridge Wells , where we are all hopelessly behind the times . ”
3465	3468	3470	3470	Lucy	129	“ Yes , ”
3542	3555	3531	3532	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion . ”
3562	3587	3557	3558	the girl	381	“ I must have been selfish or unkind ; I must be more careful . It is so dreadful for Charlotte , being poor . ”
3759	3776	3883	3886	the little old lady	422	“ But here you are as safe as in England . Signora Bertolini is so English . ”
3777	3783	3786	3786	Lucy	129	“ Yet our rooms smell , ”
3788	3795	3786	3786	Lucy	129	“ We dread going to bed . ”
3796	3806	3807	3807	She	381	“ Ah , then you look into the court . ”
3810	3828	3807	3807	She	381	“ If only Mr. Emerson was more tactful ! We were so sorry for you at dinner . ”
3829	3839	3883	3886	the little old lady	422	“ I think he was meaning to be kind . ”
3840	3845	3847	3848	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Undoubtedly he was , ”
3850	3876	3883	3886	the little old lady	422	“ Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature . Of course , I was holding back on my cousin ’s account . ”
3877	3881	3883	3886	the little old lady	422	“ Of course , ”
3939	3983	3903	3903	Lucy	129	“ About old Mr. Emerson — I hardly know . No , he is not tactful ; yet , have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate , and yet at the same time — beautiful ? ”
3984	3987	3989	3990	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Beautiful ? ”
3997	4006	3989	3990	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Are not beauty and delicacy the same ? ”
4007	4014	4016	4018	the other helplessly	429	“ So one would have thought , ”
4020	4031	4016	4018	the other helplessly	429	“ But things are so difficult , I sometimes think . ”
4048	4052	4053	4053	he	133	“ Miss Bartlett , ”
4056	4112	4053	4053	he	133	“ it ’s all right about the rooms . I ’m so glad . Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking - room , and knowing what I did , I encouraged him to make the offer again . He has let me come and ask you . He would be so pleased . ”
4113	4118	4120	4120	Lucy	129	“ Oh , Charlotte , ”
4125	4147	4120	4120	Lucy	129	“ we must have the rooms now . The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be . ”
4153	4157	4159	4160	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I fear , ”
4166	4180	4159	4160	Mr. Beebe	133	“ that I have been officious . I must apologize for my interference . ”
4197	4289	4193	4194	Miss Bartlett	128	“ My own wishes , dearest Lucy , are unimportant in comparison with yours . It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence , when I am only here through your kindness . If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms , I will do it . Would you then , Mr. Beebe , kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer , and then conduct him to me , in order that I may thank him personally ? ”
4333	4364	4292	4292	her	431	“ Remember , Lucy , I alone am implicated in this . I do not wish the acceptance to come from you . Grant me that , at all events . ”
4374	4387	4365	4366	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Mr. Emerson is engaged , but here is his son instead . ”
4411	4415	4416	4416	he	393	“ My father , ”
4419	4455	4416	4416	he	393	“ is in his bath , so you can not thank him personally . But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out . ”
4495	4500	4502	4503	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Poor young man ! ”
4512	4534	4562	4562	he	133	“ How angry he is with his father about the rooms ! It is all he can do to keep polite . ”
4535	4548	4550	4551	Mr. Beebe	133	“ In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready , ”
4576	4581	4583	4586	the little old lady	422	“ Oh , dear ! ”
4602	4609	4610	4610	Her	422	“ Gentlemen sometimes do not realize — ”
4704	4726	4694	4695	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I think one might venture now . No , Lucy , do not stir . I will superintend the move . ”
4727	4734	4736	4736	Lucy	129	“ How you do do everything , ”
4738	4748	4694	4695	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Naturally , dear . It is my affair . ”
4749	4758	4694	4695	Miss Bartlett	128	“ But I would like to help you . ”
4759	4764	4694	4695	Miss Bartlett	128	“ No , dear . ”
4843	4849	4851	4852	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I want to explain , ”
4854	4903	4851	4852	Miss Bartlett	128	“ why it is that I have taken the largest room . Naturally , of course , I should have given it to you ; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man , and I was sure your mother would not like it . ”
4908	4972	5010	5010	she	128	“ If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him . I am a woman of the world , in my small way , and I know where things lead to . However , Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this . ”
4973	4982	4984	4984	Lucy	129	“ Mother would n’t mind I ’m sure , ”
5156	5162	5163	5163	she	128	“ What does it mean ? ”
5851	5942	5845	5847	the clever lady	392	“ If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you , I do assure you that you can neglect the good person . Being English , Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe . Italians understand . A dear friend of mine , Contessa Baroncelli , has two daughters , and when she can not send a maid to school with them , she lets them go in sailor - hats instead . Every one takes them for English , you see , especially if their hair is strained tightly behind . ”
6002	6030	5997	5997	she	392	“ I will take you by a dear dirty back way , Miss Honeychurch , and if you bring me luck , we shall have an adventure . ”
6053	6106	5997	5997	she	392	“ Tut , tut ! Miss Lucy ! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker . He does but touch the surface of things . As to the true Italy — he does not even dream of it . The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation . ”
6265	6287	6262	6262	she	127	“ A smell ! a true Florentine smell ! Every city , let me teach you , has its own smell . ”
6288	6296	6298	6298	Lucy	129	“ Is it a very nice smell ? ”
6311	6321	6258	6258	she	127	“ One does n’t come to Italy for niceness , ”
6326	6338	6258	6258	she	127	“ one comes for life . Buon giorno ! Buon giorno ! ”
6344	6365	6258	6258	she	127	“ Look at that adorable wine - cart ! How the driver stares at us , dear , simple soul ! ”
6434	6483	6763	6764	Miss Lavish	127	“ Buon giorno ! Take the word of an old woman , Miss Lucy : you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors . That is the true democracy . Though I am a real Radical as well . There , now you ’re shocked . ”
6484	6491	6493	6493	Lucy	129	“ Indeed , I ’m not ! ”
6495	6522	6493	6493	Lucy	129	“ We are Radicals , too , out and out . My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone , until he was so dreadful about Ireland . ”
6523	6540	6763	6764	Miss Lavish	127	“ I see , I see . And now you have gone over to the enemy . ”
6541	6601	6493	6493	Lucy	129	“ Oh , please — ! If my father was alive , I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right . And as it is , the glass over our front door was broken last election , and Freddy is sure it was the Tories ; but mother says nonsense , a tramp . ”
6602	6612	6763	6764	Miss Lavish	127	“ Shameful ! A manufacturing district , I suppose ? ”
6613	6632	6493	6493	Lucy	129	“ No — in the Surrey hills . About five miles from Dorking , looking over the Weald . ”
6643	6678	6763	6764	Miss Lavish	127	“ What a delightful part ; I know it so well . It is full of the very nicest people . Do you know Sir Harry Otway — a Radical if ever there was ? ”
6679	6684	6763	6764	Miss Lavish	127	“ Very well indeed . ”
6685	6693	6763	6764	Miss Lavish	127	“ And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist ? ”
6694	6707	6763	6764	Miss Lavish	127	“ Why , she rents a field of us ! How funny ! ”
6721	6730	6708	6709	Miss Lavish	127	“ Oh , you have property in Surrey ? ”
6731	6735	6737	6737	Lucy	129	“ Hardly any , ”
6746	6762	6743	6744	a snob	499	“ Only thirty acres — just the garden , all downhill , and some fields . ”
6839	6855	6833	6833	she	127	“ Bless us ! Bless us and save us ! We ’ve lost the way . ”
6904	6958	6882	6883	Miss Lavish	127	“ Lost ! lost ! My dear Miss Lucy , during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning . How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us ! What are we to do ? Two lone females in an unknown town . Now , this is what I call an adventure . ”
6983	7029	6959	6959	Lucy	129	“ Oh , but that is the word of a craven ! And no , you are not , not , not to look at your Baedeker . Give it to me ; I sha n’t let you carry it . We will simply drift . ”
7284	7328	7415	7416	Miss Lavish	127	“ Stop a minute ; let those two people go on , or I shall have to speak to them . I do detest conventional intercourse . Nasty ! they are going into the church , too . Oh , the Britisher abroad ! ”
7329	7352	7415	7416	Miss Lavish	127	“ We sat opposite them at dinner last night . They have given us their rooms . They were so very kind . ”
7353	7359	7361	7362	Miss Lavish	127	“ Look at their figures ! ”
7364	7406	7361	7362	Miss Lavish	127	“ They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows . It ’s very naughty of me , but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover , and turn back every tourist who could n’t pass it . ”
7407	7414	7415	7416	Miss Lavish	127	“ What would you ask us ? ”
7476	7493	7470	7470	her	127	“ There goes my local - colour box ! I must have a word with him ! ”
8105	8109	8114	8116	old Mr. Emerson	126	“ Hateful bishop ! ”
8124	8162	8114	8116	old Mr. Emerson	126	“ Hard in life , hard in death . Go out into the sunshine , little boy , and kiss your hand to the sun , for that is where you ought to be . Intolerable bishop ! ”
8196	8201	8203	8204	Mr. Emerson	126	“ Look at him ! ”
8208	8233	8203	8204	Mr. Emerson	126	“ Here ’s a mess : a baby hurt , cold , and frightened ! But what else can you expect from a church ? ”
8318	8325	8327	8328	Mr. Emerson	126	“ You are a clever woman , ”
8330	8372	8327	8328	Mr. Emerson	126	“ You have done more than all the relics in the world . I am not of your creed , but I do believe in those who make their fellow - creatures happy . There is no scheme of the universe — ”
8379	8382	8384	8386	the Italian lady	551	“ Niente , ”
8394	8403	8405	8405	Lucy	129	“ I ’m not sure she understands English , ”
8452	8458	8460	8461	Mr. Emerson	126	“ That woman understands everything , ”
8465	8486	8460	8461	Mr. Emerson	126	“ But what are you doing here ? Are you doing the church ? Are you through with the church ? ”
8487	8490	8492	8492	Lucy	129	“ No , ”
8498	8541	8492	8492	Lucy	129	“ I came here with Miss Lavish , who was to explain everything ; and just by the door — it is too bad!—she simply ran away , and after waiting quite a time , I had to come in by myself . ”
8542	8548	8550	8551	Mr. Emerson	126	“ Why should n’t you ? ”
8553	8564	8566	8567	the son	367	“ Yes , why should n’t you come by yourself ? ”
8578	8588	8492	8492	Lucy	129	“ But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker . ”
8589	8592	8594	8595	Mr. Emerson	126	“ Baedeker ? ”
8597	8623	8594	8595	Mr. Emerson	126	“ I ’m glad it ’s that you minded . It ’s worth minding , the loss of a Baedeker . That ’s worth minding . ”
8647	8654	8656	8657	the son	367	“ If you ’ve no Baedeker , ”
8659	8666	8656	8657	the son	367	“ you ’d better join us . ”
8682	8747	8624	8624	Lucy	129	“ Thank you very much , but I could not think of that . I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you . I really came to help with the child , and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night . I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience . ”
8748	8752	8754	8756	the old man	360	“ My dear , ”
8759	8817	8754	8756	the old man	360	“ I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say . You are pretending to be touchy ; but you are not really . Stop being so tiresome , and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see . To take you to it will be a real pleasure . ”
8920	8949	8915	8915	she	557	“ I am not touchy , I hope . It is the Giottos that I want to see , if you will kindly tell me which they are . ”
9035	9038	9039	9039	he	570	“ Remember , ”
9043	9131	9039	9039	he	570	“ the facts about this church of Santa Croce ; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism , before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared . Observe how Giotto in these frescoes — now , unhappily , ruined by restoration — is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective . Could anything be more majestic , more pathetic , beautiful , true ? How little , we feel , avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels ! ”
9132	9135	9137	9138	Mr. Emerson	126	“ No ! ”
9149	9213	9137	9138	Mr. Emerson	126	“ Remember nothing of the sort ! Built by faith indeed ! That simply means the workmen were n’t paid properly . And as for the frescoes , I see no truth in them . Look at that fat man in blue ! He must weigh as much as I do , and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon . ”
9222	9228	9214	9214	He	570	“ Ascension of St. John . ”
9290	9306	9274	9274	They	574	“ Now , did this happen , or did n’t it ? Yes or no ? ”
9310	9359	9307	9307	George	126	“ It happened like this , if it happened at all . I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs ; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it , just as they do here . ”
9360	9367	9369	9370	his father	395	“ You will never go up , ”
9372	9403	9369	9370	his father	395	“ You and I , dear boy , will lie at peace in the earth that bore us , and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives . ”
9404	9439	9369	9370	his father	395	“ Some of the people can only see the empty grave , not the saint , whoever he is , going up . It did happen like that , if it happened at all . ”
9440	9444	9369	9370	his father	395	“ Pardon me , ”
9450	9467	9369	9370	his father	395	“ The chapel is somewhat small for two parties . We will incommode you no longer . ”
9528	9531	9533	9534	Mr. Emerson	126	“ Stop ! ”
9536	9548	9533	9534	Mr. Emerson	126	“ There ’s plenty of room for us all . Stop ! ”
9574	9587	9557	9558	the lecturer	572	“ George , I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate . ”
9598	9608	9588	9588	George	126	“ Perhaps he is . I do n’t remember . ”
9609	9665	9557	9558	the lecturer	572	“ Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am . It ’s that Mr. Eager . Why did he go ? Did we talk too loud ? How vexatious . I shall go and say we are sorry . Had n’t I better ? Then perhaps he will come back . ”
9666	9673	9675	9675	George	126	“ He will not come back , ”
9748	9758	9759	9759	he	588	“ My father has that effect on nearly everyone , ”
9763	9771	9759	9759	he	588	“ He will try to be kind . ”
9772	9779	9781	9781	she	129	“ I hope we all try , ”
9786	9819	9759	9759	he	588	“ Because we think it improves our characters . But he is kind to people because he loves them ; and they find him out , and are offended , or frightened . ”
9820	9826	9828	9828	Lucy	129	“ How silly of them ! ”
9837	9847	9828	9828	Lucy	129	“ I think that a kind action done tactfully — ”
9848	9851	9852	9852	He	588	“ Tact ! ”
10003	10008	10010	10011	his son	366	“ Were you snubbed ? ”
10014	10036	10085	10085	Lucy	129	“ But we have spoilt the pleasure of I do n’t know how many people . They wo n’t come back . ”
10037	10058	10085	10085	Lucy	129	“ ... full of innate sympathy ... quickness to perceive good in others ... vision of the brotherhood of man ... ”
10073	10081	10082	10082	he	126	“ Do n’t let us spoil yours , ”
10087	10095	10082	10082	he	126	“ Have you looked at those saints ? ”
10096	10099	10101	10101	Lucy	129	“ Yes , ”
10103	10121	10101	10101	Lucy	129	“ They are lovely . Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin ? ”
10247	10256	10257	10257	he	126	“ Why will he look at that fresco ? ”
10261	10268	10257	10257	he	126	“ I saw nothing in it . ”
10269	10274	10275	10275	she	605	“ I like Giotto , ”
10278	10302	10275	10275	she	605	“ It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values . Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better . ”
10303	10338	10257	10257	he	126	“ So you ought . A baby is worth a dozen saints . And my baby ’s worth the whole of Paradise , and as far as I can see he lives in Hell . ”
10348	10352	10353	10353	he	605	“ In Hell , ”
10356	10361	10353	10353	he	605	“ He ’s unhappy . ”
10362	10367	10369	10369	Lucy	129	“ Oh , dear ! ”
10371	10438	10353	10353	he	605	“ How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive ? What more is one to give him ? And think how he has been brought up — free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God . With such an education as that , I thought he was bound to grow up happy . ”
10489	10498	10499	10499	he	606	“ What are we to do with him ? ”
10502	10544	10499	10499	he	606	“ He comes out for his holiday to Italy , and behaves — like that ; like the little child who ought to have been playing , and who hurt himself upon the tombstone . Eh ? What did you say ? ”
10555	10704	10552	10552	he	606	“ Now do n’t be stupid over this . I do n’t require you to fall in love with my boy , but I do think you might try and understand him . You are nearer his age , and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible . You might help me . He has known so few women , and you have the time . You stop here several weeks , I suppose ? But let yourself go . You are inclined to get muddled , if I may judge from last night . Let yourself go . Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand , and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them . By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself . It will be good for both of you . ”
10714	10732	10809	10809	he	610	“ I only know what it is that ’s wrong with him ; not why it is . ”
10733	10739	10741	10741	Lucy	129	“ And what is it ? ”
10749	10759	10809	10809	he	610	“ The old trouble ; things wo n’t fit . ”
10760	10764	10809	10809	he	610	“ What things ? ”
10765	10781	10809	10809	he	610	“ The things of the universe . It is quite true . They do n’t . ”
10782	10793	10795	10795	his	610	“ Oh , Mr. Emerson , whatever do you mean ? ”
10812	10842	10809	10809	he	610	“ ‘ From far , from eve and morning , And yon twelve - winded sky , The stuff of life to knit me Blew hither : here am I ’
10921	10921	10912	10912	I	0	”
10926	10962	10922	10923	Miss Honeychurch	129	“ Then make my boy think like us . Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes — a transitory Yes if you like , but a Yes . ”
11000	11006	11007	11007	she	129	“ I ’m very sorry , ”
11010	11021	11007	11007	she	129	“ You ’ll think me unfeeling , but — but — ”
11027	11086	11023	11023	she	129	“ Oh , but your son wants employment . Has he no particular hobby ? Why , I myself have worries , but I can generally forget them at the piano ; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother . Perhaps Italy bores him ; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes . ”
11198	11202	11195	11195	He	360	“ Miss Bartlett . ”
11203	11210	11212	11212	Lucy	129	“ Oh , good gracious me ! ”
11228	11233	11212	11212	Lucy	129	“ Where ? Where ? ”
11234	11239	11195	11195	He	360	“ In the nave . ”
11240	11252	11253	11253	She	129	“ I see . Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have — ”
11257	11261	11263	11264	Mr. Emerson	171	“ Poor girl ! ”
11266	11270	11263	11264	Mr. Emerson	171	“ Poor girl ! ”
11288	11387	11388	11388	She	129	“ Poor girl ? I fail to understand the point of that remark . I think myself a very fortunate girl , I assure you . I ’m thoroughly happy , and having a splendid time . Pray do n’t waste time mourning over me . There ’s enough sorrow in the world , is n’t there , without trying to invent it . Good - bye . Thank you both so much for all your kindness . Ah , yes ! there does come my cousin . A delightful morning ! Santa Croce is a wonderful church . ”
11402	11404	11388	11388	She	129	“ S ”
11934	11942	11944	11945	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Miss Honeychurch . Piano . Beethoven , ”
12084	12089	12090	12090	he	133	“ Who is she ? ”
12096	12144	12090	12090	he	133	“ Cousin of one of my parishioners . I do not consider her choice of a piece happy . Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that , which , if anything , disturbs . ”
12145	12149	12090	12090	he	133	“ Introduce me . ”
12150	12169	12090	12090	he	133	“ She will be delighted . She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon . ”
12170	12174	12176	12177	Mr. Beebe	133	“ My sermon ? ”
12179	12188	12176	12177	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Why ever did she listen to it ? ”
12292	12316	12281	12281	she	129	“ If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays , it will be very exciting both for us and for her . ”
12326	12355	12317	12317	Lucy	129	“ Oh , what a funny thing ! Some one said just the same to mother , and she said she trusted I should never live a duet . ”
12356	12364	12281	12281	she	129	“ Does n’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music ? ”
12365	12443	12317	12317	Lucy	129	“ She does n’t mind it . But she does n’t like one to get excited over anything ; she thinks I am silly about it . She thinks — I ca n’t make out . Once , you know , I said that I liked my own playing better than any one ’s . She has never got over it . Of course , I did n’t mean that I played well ; I only meant — ”
12444	12448	12450	12450	he	651	“ Of course , ”
12459	12462	12464	12464	Lucy	129	“ Music — ”
12558	12563	12565	12566	Mr. Beebe	133	“ What about music ? ”
12568	12575	12577	12577	Lucy	129	“ Poor Charlotte will be sopped , ”
12667	12689	12639	12639	she	128	“ Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray . She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe . ”
12690	12697	12699	12699	Lucy	129	“ Miss Lavish is so original , ”
12756	12761	12763	12763	Lucy	129	“ Is it true , ”
12770	12779	12763	12763	Lucy	129	“ that Miss Lavish is writing a book ? ”
12780	12786	12803	12804	Mr. Beebe	133	“ They do say so . ”
12787	12793	12763	12763	Lucy	129	“ What is it about ? ”
12794	12801	12803	12804	Mr. Beebe	133	“ It will be a novel , ”
12806	12836	12803	12804	Mr. Beebe	133	“ dealing with modern Italy . Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan , who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know . ”
12837	12895	12763	12763	Lucy	129	“ I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself . We started such friends . But I do n’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce . Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone , and so I could n’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish . ”
12896	12910	12911	12911	He	664	“ The two ladies , at all events , have made it up . ”
13152	13196	13138	13140	Miss Catharine Alan	167	“ Oh , dear Miss Honeychurch , you will catch a chill ! And Mr. Beebe here besides . Who would suppose this is Italy ? There is my sister actually nursing the hot - water can ; no comforts or proper provisions . ”
13228	13278	13209	13209	she	129	“ I could hear your beautiful playing , Miss Honeychurch , though I was in my room with the door shut . Doors shut ; indeed , most necessary . No one has the least idea of privacy in this country . And one person catches it from another . ”
13312	13319	13320	13320	He	133	“ Fa niente , sono vecchia . ”
13326	13475	13320	13320	He	133	“ I quite agree with you , Miss Alan . The Italians are a most unpleasant people . They pry everywhere , they see everything , and they know what we want before we know it ourselves . We are at their mercy . They read our thoughts , they foretell our desires . From the cab - driver down to — to Giotto , they turn us inside out , and I resent it . Yet in their heart of hearts they are — how superficial ! They have no conception of the intellectual life . How right is Signora Bertolini , who exclaimed to me the other day : ‘ Ho , Mr. Beebe , if you knew what I suffer over the children ’s edjucaishion . Hi wo n’t ’ ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what ca n’t explain nothink ! ’ ”
13588	13591	13570	13570	she	167	“ E. L. ”
13592	13598	13600	13601	the clergyman	380	“ That belongs to Lavish . ”
13603	13619	13600	13601	the clergyman	380	“ A good fellow , Lavish , but I wish she ’d start a pipe . ”
13620	13626	13628	13629	Miss Alan	167	“ Oh , Mr. Beebe , ”
13637	13687	13628	13629	Miss Alan	167	“ Indeed , though it is dreadful for her to smoke , it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose . She took to it , practically in despair , after her life ’s work was carried away in a landslip . Surely that makes it more excusable . ”
13688	13693	13695	13695	Lucy	129	“ What was that ? ”
13710	13961	13704	13705	Miss Alan	167	“ It was a novel — and I am afraid , from what I can gather , not a very nice novel . It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them , and I must say they nearly always do . Anyhow , she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink . She said : ‘ Can I have a little ink , please ? ’ But you know what Italians are , and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach , and the saddest thing of all is that she can not remember what she has written . The poor thing was very ill after it , and so got tempted into cigarettes . It is a great secret , but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel . She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour — this novel is to be about modern Italy ; the other was historical — but that she could not start till she had an idea . First she tried Perugia for an inspiration , then she came here — this must on no account get round . And so cheerful through it all ! I can not help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone , even if you do not approve of them . ”
14019	14047	14002	14002	She	167	“ All the same , she is a little too — I hardly like to say unwomanly , but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived . ”
14074	14114	14140	14140	she	167	“ I do n’t know , Miss Honeychurch , if you have noticed that Miss Pole , the lady who has so much yellow hair , takes lemonade . That old Mr. Emerson , who puts things very strangely — ”
14149	14585	14140	14140	she	167	“ Stomach . He warned Miss Pole of her stomach - acidity , he called it — and he may have meant to be kind . I must say I forgot myself and laughed ; it was so sudden . As Teresa truly said , it was no laughing matter . But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively attracted by his mentioning S. , and said she liked plain speaking , and meeting different grades of thought . She thought they were commercial travellers—‘drummers ’ was the word she used — and all through dinner she tried to prove that England , our great and beloved country , rests on nothing but commerce . Teresa was very much annoyed , and left the table before the cheese , saying as she did so : ‘ There , Miss Lavish , is one who can confute you better than I , ’ and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson . Then Miss Lavish said : ‘ Tut ! The early Victorians . ’ Just imagine ! ‘ Tut ! The early Victorians . ’ My sister had gone , and I felt bound to speak . I said : ‘ Miss Lavish , I am an early Victorian ; at least , that is to say , I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen . ’ It was horrible speaking . I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go , and I must say she was dumbfounded , and made no reply . But , unluckily , Mr. Emerson overheard this part , and called in his deep voice : ‘ Quite so , quite so ! I honour the woman for her Irish visit . ’ The woman ! I tell things so badly ; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time , all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place . But that was not all . After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said : ‘ Miss Alan , I am going into the smoking - room to talk to those two nice men . Come , too . ’ Needless to say , I refused such an unsuitable invitation , and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas , and said that she had four brothers , all University men , except one who was in the army , who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers . ”
14586	14593	14595	14596	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Let me finish the story , ”
14602	14647	14140	14140	she	167	“ Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole , myself , everyone , and finally said : ‘ I shall go alone . ’ She went . At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board , and began playing patience . ”
14648	14652	14654	14654	Lucy	129	“ Whatever happened ? ”
14656	14685	14140	14140	she	167	“ No one knows . No one will ever know . Miss Lavish will never dare to tell , and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling . ”
14686	14708	14140	14140	she	167	“ Mr. Beebe — old Mr. Emerson , is he nice or not nice ? I do so want to know . ”
14723	14758	14140	14140	she	167	“ No ; but it is so difficult . Sometimes he is so silly , and then I do not mind him . Miss Alan , what do you think ? Is he nice ? ”
14785	14808	14771	14772	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I consider that you are bound to class him as nice , Miss Alan , after that business of the violets . ”
14809	14887	14771	14772	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Violets ? Oh , dear ! Who told you about the violets ? How do things get round ? A pension is a bad place for gossips . No , I can not forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager ’s lecture at Santa Croce . Oh , poor Miss Honeychurch ! It really was too bad . No , I have quite changed . I do not like the Emersons . They are not nice . ”
15115	15131	15133	15135	the little lady	694	“ But are n’t they always waylaying you to go out with them , dear ? ”
15138	15158	15133	15135	the little lady	694	“ Only once . Charlotte did n’t like it , and said something — quite politely , of course . ”
15159	15178	15133	15135	the little lady	694	“ Most right of her . They do n’t understand our ways . They must find their level . ”
15336	15343	15345	15346	Miss Alan	167	“ Too late to go out , ”
15353	15360	15345	15346	Miss Alan	167	“ All the galleries are shut . ”
15361	15369	15371	15371	Lucy	129	“ I think I shall go out , ”
15373	15393	15371	15371	Lucy	129	“ I want to go round the town in the circular tram — on the platform by the driver . ”
15419	15448	15400	15401	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I wish we could . Unluckily I have letters . If you do want to go out alone , wo n’t you be better on your feet ? ”
15449	15457	15459	15460	Miss Alan	167	“ Italians , dear , you know , ”
15462	15475	15400	15401	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through ! ”
15512	15522	15524	15525	Mr. Beebe	133	“ She ought n’t really to go at all , ”
15535	15550	15524	15525	Mr. Beebe	133	“ and she knows it . I put it down to too much Beethoven . ”
16045	16050	16051	16051	Venus	183	“ Birth of Venus . ”
16090	16093	16066	16067	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Tempesta , ”
16095	16098	16066	16067	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Idolino , ”
16125	16128	16156	16156	she	129	“ Coronation , ”
16131	16137	16156	16156	she	129	“ Ascension of St. John , ”
16201	16205	16206	16206	she	129	“ The world , ”
16209	16225	16206	16206	she	129	“ is certainly full of beautiful things , if only I could come across them . ”
16251	16258	16259	16259	she	129	“ Nothing ever happens to me , ”
16496	16500	16501	16501	they	743	“ Cinque lire , ”
16505	16509	16510	16510	They	743	“ cinque lire ! ”
16673	16681	16670	16670	She	129	“ Oh , what have I done ? ”
16682	16690	16691	16691	she	129	“ Oh , what have I done ? ”
16766	16774	16763	16763	She	129	“ Oh , what have I done ? ”
16775	16779	16763	16763	She	129	“ You fainted . ”
16780	16788	16763	16763	She	129	“ I — I am very sorry . ”
16789	16795	16763	16763	She	129	“ How are you now ? ”
16796	16803	16805	16805	she	129	“ Perfectly well — absolutely well . ”
16812	16827	16828	16828	He	738	“ Then let us come home . There ’s no point in our stopping . ”
16871	16900	16828	16828	He	738	“ How very kind you have been ! I might have hurt myself falling . But now I am well . I can go alone , thank you . ”
16907	16913	16914	16914	she	129	“ Oh , my photographs ! ”
16918	16922	16914	16914	she	129	“ What photographs ? ”
16923	16943	16944	16944	She	129	“ I bought some photographs at Alinari ’s . I must have dropped them out there in the square . ”
16950	16961	16944	16944	She	129	“ Would you add to your kindness by fetching them ? ”
16994	16998	16999	16999	She	129	“ Miss Honeychurch ! ”
17008	17022	16999	16999	She	129	“ You sit still ; you are n’t fit to go home alone . ”
17023	17035	16999	16999	She	129	“ Yes , I am , thank you so very much . ”
17036	17051	16999	16999	She	129	“ No , you are n’t . You ’d go openly if you were . ”
17052	17058	16999	16999	She	129	“ But I had rather — ”
17059	17068	16999	16999	She	129	“ Then I do n’t fetch your photographs . ”
17069	17076	16999	16999	She	129	“ I had rather be alone . ”
17081	17100	17077	17077	He	758	“ The man is dead — the man is probably dead ; sit down till you are rested . ”
17109	17119	17107	17107	him	758	“ And do n’t move till I come back . ”
17176	17182	17174	17174	her	129	“ Oh , what have I done?”—the
17288	17344	17278	17279	a cabman	764	“ And the murderer tried to kiss him , you say — how very odd Italians are!—and gave himself up to the police ! Mr. Beebe was saying that Italians know everything , but I think they are rather childish . When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday — What was that ? ”
17353	17360	17345	17345	He	764	“ What did you throw in ? ”
17361	17368	17369	17369	he	764	“ Things I did n’t want , ”
17373	17377	17345	17345	He	764	“ Mr. Emerson ! ”
17378	17381	17345	17345	He	764	“ Well ? ”
17382	17388	17345	17345	He	764	“ Where are the photographs ? ”
17393	17405	17389	17389	He	764	“ I believe it was my photographs that you threw away . ”
17406	17417	17418	17418	he	764	“ I did n’t know what to do with them , ”
17441	17475	17476	17476	He	764	“ They were covered with blood . There ! I ’m glad I ’ve told you ; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them . ”
17482	17487	17476	17476	He	764	“ They ’ve gone . ”
17495	17534	17569	17569	Something	187	“ I did mind them so , and one is so foolish , it seemed better that they should go out to the sea — I do n’t know ; I may just mean that they frightened me . ”
17543	17568	17536	17537	the boy	772	“ For something tremendous has happened ; I must face it without getting muddled . It is n’t exactly that a man has died . ”
17578	17583	17584	17584	he	764	“ It has happened , ”
17587	17598	17584	17584	he	764	“ and I mean to find out what it is . ”
17599	17603	17604	17604	He	764	“ Mr. Emerson — ”
17621	17633	17604	17604	He	764	“ I want to ask you something before we go in . ”
17690	17696	17683	17683	She	129	“ I have behaved ridiculously . ”
17704	17726	17697	17697	He	764	“ I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life ; I can not think what came over me . ”
17727	17733	17734	17734	he	764	“ I nearly fainted myself , ”
17746	17756	17738	17738	she	129	“ Well , I owe you a thousand apologies . ”
17757	17763	17738	17738	she	129	“ Oh , all right . ”
17764	17794	17738	17738	she	129	“ And — this is the real point — you know how silly people are gossiping — ladies especially , I am afraid — you understand what I mean ? ”
17795	17803	17738	17738	she	129	“ I ’m afraid I do n’t . ”
17804	17821	17738	17738	she	129	“ I mean , would you not mention it to any one , my foolish behaviour ? ”
17822	17836	17738	17738	she	129	“ Your behaviour ? Oh , yes , all right — all right . ”
17837	17847	17738	17738	she	129	“ Thank you so much . And would you — ”
17961	17966	17970	17970	he	779	“ And would you — ”
18060	18068	18069	18069	she	129	“ Well , thank you so much , ”
18072	18089	18069	18069	she	129	“ How quickly these accidents do happen , and then one returns to the old life ! ”
18090	18095	18096	18096	Anxiety	188	“ I do n’t . ”
18108	18116	18103	18103	His	779	“ I shall probably want to live . ”
18117	18129	18096	18096	Anxiety	188	“ But why , Mr. Emerson ? What do you mean ? ”
18130	18140	18103	18103	His	779	“ I shall want to live , I say . ”
18178	18189	18190	18190	She	129	“ you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn . ”
18338	18343	18316	18317	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Too much Beethoven . ”
18505	18510	18512	18513	the girl	381	“ No , Charlotte ! ”
18519	18541	18512	18513	the girl	381	“ It ’s very kind of Mr. Beebe , but I am certainly coming with you . I had much rather . ”
18542	18548	18550	18551	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Very well , dear , ”
18656	18671	18647	18647	She	128	“ How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this , too ! ”
18688	18715	18685	18685	she	128	“ Look , Lucia ! Oh , you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party . I feared you would repent you of your choice . ”
18924	18932	18934	18935	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Oh , let me congratulate you ! ”
18937	18949	18934	18935	Miss Bartlett	128	“ After your despair of yesterday ! What a fortunate thing ! ”
18950	18980	18981	18981	Lucy	129	“ Aha ! Miss Honeychurch , come you here I am in luck . Now , you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning . ”
18990	18998	18981	18981	Lucy	129	“ But perhaps you would rather not ? ”
18999	19018	18981	18981	Lucy	129	“ I ’m sorry — if you could manage without it , I think I would rather not . ”
19039	19047	19049	19050	Miss Lavish	127	“ It is I who am sorry , ”
19052	19077	19049	19050	Miss Lavish	127	“ We literary hacks are shameless creatures . I believe there ’s no secret of the human heart into which we would n’t pry . ”
19172	19180	19182	19183	Miss Bartlett	128	“ What is the heroine ’s name ? ”
19185	19188	19190	19191	Miss Lavish	127	“ Leonora , ”
19199	19207	19182	19183	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I do hope she ’s nice . ”
19215	19222	19182	19183	Miss Bartlett	128	“ And what is the plot ? ”
19251	19264	19265	19266	Miss Lavish	127	“ I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this , ”
19269	19334	19265	19266	Miss Lavish	127	“ It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people . Of course , this is the barest outline . There will be a deal of local colouring , descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood , and I shall also introduce some humorous characters . And let me give you all fair warning : I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist . ”
19335	19342	19344	19345	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Oh , you wicked woman , ”
19347	19358	19344	19345	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons . ”
19366	19438	19359	19360	Miss Lavish	127	“ I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen . It is the neglected Italians who attract me , and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can . For I repeat and I insist , and I have always held most strongly , that a tragedy such as yesterday ’s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life . ”
19467	19478	19480	19481	Miss Bartlett	128	“ She is my idea of a really clever woman , ”
19483	19502	19480	19481	Miss Bartlett	128	“ That last remark struck me as so particularly true . It should be a most pathetic novel . ”
19541	19557	19559	19560	Miss Bartlett	128	“ She is emancipated , but only in the very best sense of the word , ”
19563	19620	19559	19560	Miss Bartlett	128	“ None but the superficial would be shocked at her . We had a long talk yesterday . She believes in justice and truth and human interest . She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman — Mr. Eager ! Why , how nice ! What a pleasant surprise ! ”
19621	19628	19630	19631	the chaplain	820	“ Ah , not for me , ”
19634	19650	19630	19631	the chaplain	820	“ for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time . ”
19651	19659	19559	19560	Miss Bartlett	128	“ We were chatting to Miss Lavish . ”
19664	19679	19630	19631	the chaplain	820	“ So I saw . Were you indeed ? Andate via ! sono occupato ! ”
19699	19828	19686	19697	a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile	821	“ I am about to venture a suggestion . Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week — a drive in the hills ? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano . There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour ’s ramble on the hillside . The view thence of Florence is most beautiful — far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole . It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures . That man had a decided feeling for landscape . Decidedly . But who looks at it to - day ? Ah , the world is too much for us . ”
20129	20138	20140	20141	the chaplain	820	“ So we shall be a partie carrée , ”
20143	20187	20140	20141	the chaplain	820	“ In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity . Andate via ! andate presto , presto ! Ah , the town ! Beautiful as it is , it is the town . ”
20191	20231	20140	20141	the chaplain	820	“ This very square — so I am told — witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies . To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration — portentous and humiliating . ”
20232	20236	20238	20239	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Humiliating indeed , ”
20241	20262	20263	20263	She	128	“ Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened . She can hardly bear to speak of it . ”
20269	20279	20281	20282	the chaplain	820	“ And how came we to have you here ? ”
20296	20317	20285	20286	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Do not blame her , please , Mr. Eager . The fault is mine : I left her unchaperoned . ”
20318	20328	20329	20329	His	820	“ So you were here alone , Miss Honeychurch ? ”
20364	20367	20350	20350	His	820	“ Practically . ”
20368	20379	20381	20382	Miss Bartlett	128	“ One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home , ”
20392	20423	20350	20350	His	820	“ For her also it must have been a terrible experience . I trust that neither of you was at all — that it was not in your immediate proximity ? ”
20463	20473	20475	20475	her	128	“ He died by the fountain , I believe , ”
20478	20485	20569	20569	He	844	“ And you and your friend — ”
20486	20493	20454	20455	George Emerson	126	“ Were over at the Loggia . ”
20494	20548	20569	20569	He	844	“ That must have saved you much . You have not , of course , seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press — This man is a public nuisance ; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well , and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views . ”
20599	20605	20607	20608	the chaplain	820	“ This is too much ! ”
20645	20651	20653	20654	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Willingly would I purchase — ”
20656	20660	20662	20663	Mr. Eager	169	“ Ignore him , ”
21007	21051	21052	21052	They	855	“ The son of a labourer ; I happen to know it for a fact . A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young ; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press . I came across him at Brixton . ”
21059	21068	21070	21071	Miss Bartlett	128	“ How wonderfully people rise in these days ! ”
21083	21086	21088	21089	Mr. Eager	169	“ Generally , ”
21091	21145	21088	21089	Mr. Eager	169	“ one has only sympathy for their success . The desire for education and for social advance — in these things there is something not wholly vile . There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence — little as they would make of it . ”
21146	21153	21154	21155	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Is he a journalist now ? ”
21158	21169	21170	21170	He	169	“ He is not ; he made an advantageous marriage . ”
21187	21196	21088	21089	Mr. Eager	169	“ Oh , so he has a wife . ”
21197	21271	21170	21170	He	169	“ Dead , Miss Bartlett , dead . I wonder — yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face , to dare to claim acquaintance with me . He was in my London parish long ago . The other day in Santa Croce , when he was with Miss Honeychurch , I snubbed him . Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub . ”
21272	21275	21277	21277	Lucy	129	“ What ? ”
21281	21284	21286	21287	Mr. Eager	169	“ Exposure ! ”
21345	21350	21351	21351	she	129	“ Do you mean , ”
21354	21367	21351	21351	she	129	“ that he is an irreligious man ? We know that already . ”
21368	21373	21375	21376	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Lucy , dear — ”
21385	21423	21351	21351	she	129	“ I should be astonished if you knew all . The boy — an innocent child at the time — I will exclude . God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him . ”
21424	21427	21429	21430	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Perhaps , ”
21432	21443	21429	21430	Miss Bartlett	128	“ it is something that we had better not hear . ”
21444	21449	21451	21452	Mr. Eager	169	“ To speak plainly , ”
21454	21464	21451	21452	Mr. Eager	169	“ it is . I will say no more . ”
21486	21493	21510	21510	He	169	“ You have said very little . ”
21494	21504	21506	21506	his	169	“ It was my intention to say very little , ”
21560	21569	21570	21570	he	169	“ Murder , if you want to know , ”
21574	21581	21570	21570	he	169	“ That man murdered his wife ! ”
21582	21585	21586	21586	she	381	“ How ? ”
21589	21612	21570	21570	he	169	“ To all intents and purposes he murdered her . That day in Santa Croce — did they say anything against me ? ”
21613	21626	21570	21570	he	169	“ Not a word , Mr. Eager — not a single word . ”
21627	21655	21570	21570	he	169	“ Oh , I thought they had been libelling me to you . But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them . ”
21656	21663	21665	21665	Lucy	129	“ I ’m not defending them , ”
21679	21686	21665	21665	Lucy	129	“ They ’re nothing to me . ”
21687	21697	21699	21700	Miss Bartlett	128	“ How could you think she was defending them ? ”
21715	21735	21709	21710	The shopman	862	“ She will find it difficult . For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God . ”
21786	21792	21794	21794	he	862	“ I must be going , ”
21822	21834	21805	21806	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Drive ? Oh , is our drive to come off ? ”
21855	21860	21862	21863	the girl	381	“ Bother the drive ! ”
21872	21914	21862	21863	the girl	381	“ It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at all . Why should he invite us in that absurd manner ? We might as well invite him . We are each paying for ourselves . ”
21936	21979	21915	21916	Miss Bartlett	128	“ If that is so , dear — if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr. Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe , then I foresee a sad kettle of fish . ”
21980	21983	22060	22061	the Graphic	869	“ How ? ”
21984	21997	21915	21916	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come , too . ”
21998	22005	22060	22061	the Graphic	869	“ That will mean another carriage . ”
22006	22035	21915	21916	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Far worse . Mr. Eager does not like Eleanor . She knows it herself . The truth must be told ; she is too unconventional for him . ”
22196	22203	22168	22169	Happy Charlotte	194	“ where things might lead to , ”
22282	22377	22279	22279	she	129	“ Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr. Eager , or Mr. Eager who forgot when he told us , or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogether — which they could scarcely do — but in any case we must be prepared . It is you they really want ; I am only asked for appearances . You shall go with the two gentlemen , and I and Eleanor will follow behind . A one - horse carriage would do for us . Yet how difficult it is ! ”
22378	22383	22385	22386	the girl	381	“ It is indeed , ”
22395	22403	22405	22406	Miss Bartlett	128	“ What do you think about it ? ”
22419	22433	22385	22386	the girl	381	“ I do n’t know what I think , nor what I want . ”
22434	22474	22405	22406	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Oh , dear , Lucy ! I do hope Florence is n’t boring you . Speak the word , and , as you know , I would take you to the ends of the earth to - morrow . ”
22475	22481	22483	22483	Lucy	129	“ Thank you , Charlotte , ”
22660	22665	22667	22668	Miss Bartlett	128	“ And the news ? ”
22670	22681	22683	22683	Lucy	129	“ Mrs. Vyse and her son have gone to Rome , ”
22693	22700	22683	22683	Lucy	129	“ Do you know the Vyses ? ”
22701	22721	22667	22668	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Oh , not that way back . We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria . ”
22722	22751	22683	22683	Lucy	129	“ They ’re nice people , the Vyses . So clever — my idea of what ’s really clever . Do n’t you long to be in Rome ? ”
22752	22758	22667	22668	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I die for it ! ”
22890	22893	22895	22896	the girl	381	“ Charlotte ! ”
22899	22955	22895	22896	the girl	381	“ Here ’s an idea . What if we popped off to Rome to - morrow — straight to the Vyses ’ hotel ? For I do know what I want . I ’m sick of Florence . No , you said you ’d go to the ends of the earth ! Do ! Do ! ”
22965	22984	22956	22957	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Oh , you droll person ! Pray , what would become of your drive in the hills ? ”
23754	23770	23739	23741	Meanwhile Mr. Eager	169	“ So , Miss Honeychurch , you are travelling ? As a student of art ? ”
23771	23783	23739	23741	Meanwhile Mr. Eager	169	“ Oh , dear me , no — oh , no ! ”
23784	23793	23795	23796	Miss Lavish	127	“ Perhaps as a student of human nature , ”
23798	23802	23795	23796	Miss Lavish	127	“ like myself ? ”
23803	23815	23739	23741	Meanwhile Mr. Eager	169	“ Oh , no . I am here as a tourist . ”
23816	23821	23823	23824	Mr. Eager	169	“ Oh , indeed , ”
23826	23975	23823	23824	Mr. Eager	169	“ Are you indeed ? If you will not think me rude , we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little — handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence , from Florence to Rome , living herded together in pensions or hotels , quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker , their one anxiety to get ‘ done ’ or ‘ through ’ and go on somewhere else . The result is , they mix up towns , rivers , palaces in one inextricable whirl . You know the American girl in Punch who says : ‘ Say , poppa , what did we see at Rome ? ’ And the father replies : ‘ Why , guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog . ’ There ’s travelling for you . Ha ! ha ! ha ! ”
23976	23981	23983	23984	Miss Lavish	127	“ I quite agree , ”
23997	24015	23983	23984	Miss Lavish	127	“ The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo - Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace . ”
24016	24157	23823	23824	Mr. Eager	169	“ Quite so . Now , the English colony at Florence , Miss Honeychurch — and it is of considerable size , though , of course , not all equally — a few are here for trade , for example . But the greater part are students . Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico . I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left . No , you can only see it if you stand — no , do not stand ; you will fall . She is very proud of that thick hedge . Inside , perfect seclusion . One might have gone back six hundred years . Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron , which lends it an additional interest , does it not ? ”
24158	24163	24165	24166	Miss Lavish	127	“ It does indeed ! ”
24168	24184	24165	24166	Miss Lavish	127	“ Tell me , where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day ? ”
24221	24317	24212	24214	the Somebody Elses	935	“ Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ‘ Mediæval Byways ’ ? He is working at Gemistus Pletho . Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear , over the wall , the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot , dusty , unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘ do ’ Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there , and I think — think — I think how little they think what lies so near them . ”
24388	24393	24395	24396	Mr. Eager	169	“ Piano ! piano ! ”
24406	24418	24420	24421	the driver	2281	“ Va bene , signore , va bene , va bene , ”
24499	24504	24506	24506	he	189	“ Piano ! piano ! ”
24589	24595	24597	24597	he	189	“ She is my sister , ”
24695	24704	24705	24705	she	127	“ Most certainly I would let them be , ”
24708	24741	24705	24705	she	127	“ But I dare say I shall receive scant support . I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life . This is what I call an adventure . ”
24742	24748	24750	24751	Mr. Eager	169	“ We must not submit , ”
24753	24777	24750	24751	Mr. Eager	169	“ I knew he was trying it on . He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook ’s tourists . ”
24778	24782	24784	24785	Miss Lavish	127	“ Surely no ! ”
24820	24825	24826	24827	Mr. Emerson	126	“ Leave them alone , ”
24840	24889	24829	24830	the chaplain	820	“ Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there ? To be driven by lovers — A king might envy us , and if we part them it ’s more like sacrilege than anything I know . ”
25004	25007	25009	25010	the man	2468	“ Signorina ! ”
25027	25030	25034	25034	her	201	“ Signorina ! ”
25066	25071	25073	25074	Mr. Eager	169	“ Victory at last ! ”
25086	25092	25094	25095	Mr. Emerson	126	“ It is not victory , ”
25097	25111	25094	25095	Mr. Emerson	126	“ It is defeat . You have parted two people who were happy . ”
25167	25202	25159	25159	he	360	“ We have tried to buy what can not be bought with money . He has bargained to drive us , and he is doing it . We have no rights over his soul . ”
25225	25233	25234	25234	she	127	“ He was not driving us well , ”
25237	25242	25234	25234	she	127	“ He jolted us . ”
25243	25315	25203	25204	Miss Lavish	127	“ That I deny . It was as restful as sleeping . Aha ! he is jolting us now . Can you wonder ? He would like to throw us out , and most certainly he is justified . And if I were superstitious I ’d be frightened of the girl , too . It does n’t do to injure young people . Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici ? ”
25320	25354	25316	25317	Miss Lavish	127	“ Most certainly I have . Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico , or to Lorenzo , Duke of Urbino , or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature ? ”
25355	25398	25316	25317	Miss Lavish	127	“ The Lord knows . Possibly he does know , for I refer to Lorenzo the poet . He wrote a line — so I heard yesterday — which runs like this : ‘ Do n’t go fighting against the Spring . ’ ”
25409	25416	25417	25417	he	169	“ Non fate guerra al Maggio , ”
25420	25434	25417	25417	he	169	“ ‘ War not with the May ’ would render a correct meaning . ”
25435	25448	25449	25449	He	169	“ The point is , we have warred with it . Look . ”
25468	25524	25449	25449	He	169	“ Fifty miles of Spring , and we ’ve come up to admire them . Do you suppose there ’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man ? But there we go , praising the one and condemning the other as improper , ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both . ”
25887	25891	25884	25884	he	126	“ the railway . ”
25949	25953	25955	25956	Miss Lavish	127	“ The railway ! ”
25958	25973	25955	25956	Miss Lavish	127	“ Oh , but I shall die ! Of course it was the railway ! ”
25981	25998	25974	25974	She	127	“ He is the image of a porter — on , on the South - Eastern . ”
25999	26005	26008	26010	her vivacious companion	993	“ Eleanor , be quiet , ”
26012	26022	26008	26010	her vivacious companion	993	“ Hush ! They ’ll hear — the Emersons — ”
26023	26039	26075	26076	Miss Lavish	127	“ I ca n’t stop . Let me go my wicked way . A porter — ”
26040	26043	26008	26010	her vivacious companion	993	“ Eleanor ! ”
26044	26053	26056	26056	Lucy	129	“ I ’m sure it ’s all right , ”
26058	26074	26056	26056	Lucy	129	“ The Emersons wo n’t hear , and they would n’t mind if they did . ”
26084	26089	26090	26090	she	127	“ Miss Honeychurch listening ! ”
26095	26107	26090	26090	she	127	“ Pouf ! Wouf ! You naughty girl ! Go away ! ”
26108	26125	26008	26010	her vivacious companion	993	“ Oh , Lucy , you ought to be with Mr. Eager , I ’m sure . ”
26126	26142	26090	26090	she	127	“ I ca n’t find them now , and I do n’t want to either . ”
26143	26155	26008	26010	her vivacious companion	993	“ Mr. Eager will be offended . It is your party . ”
26156	26167	26090	26090	she	127	“ Please , I ’d rather stop here with you . ”
26168	26174	26176	26177	Miss Lavish	127	“ No , I agree , ”
26179	26216	26176	26177	Miss Lavish	127	“ It ’s like a school feast ; the boys have got separated from the girls . Miss Lucy , you are to go . We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear . ”
26285	26291	26293	26294	Miss Bartlett	128	“ How tired one gets , ”
26296	26310	26293	26294	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Oh , I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here . ”
26344	26350	26352	26353	Miss Lavish	127	“ Then sit you down , ”
26355	26360	26352	26353	Miss Lavish	127	“ Observe my foresight . ”
26400	26456	26457	26457	She	127	“ Lucy ; without a moment ’s doubt , Lucy . The ground will do for me . Really I have not had rheumatism for years . If I do feel it coming on I shall stand . Imagine your mother ’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen . ”
26468	26510	26511	26511	She	127	“ Here we are , all settled delightfully . Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much , being brown . Sit down , dear ; you are too unselfish ; you do n’t assert yourself enough . ”
26516	26554	26513	26513	her	127	“ Now do n’t be alarmed ; this is n’t a cold . It ’s the tiniest cough , and I have had it three days . It ’s nothing to do with sitting here at all . ”
26638	26641	26643	26643	Lucy	129	“ Dove ? ”
26719	26721	26685	26685	He	1000	“ clergyman ”
26723	26728	26730	26730	she	129	“ Dove buoni uomini ? ”
26750	26757	26759	26759	her	129	“ Uno — piu — piccolo , ”
26764	26784	26759	26759	her	129	“ Has the cigar been given to you by Mr. Beebe , the smaller of the two good men ? ”
26963	26971	26944	26944	His	1000	“ would she like to see them ? ”
26972	26977	26944	26944	His	1000	“ Ma buoni uomini . ”
27070	27075	27096	27096	He	1000	“ What is that ? ”
27147	27150	27151	27151	he	1000	“ Eccolo ! ”
27200	27203	27205	27206	her companion	1026	“ Courage ! ”
27215	27220	27205	27206	her companion	1026	“ Courage and love . ”
27411	27418	27388	27388	He	1000	“ Lucy ! Lucy ! Lucy ! ”
27659	27665	27666	27666	he	200	“ Let us go immediately , ”
27670	27676	27666	27666	he	200	“ The signorino will walk . ”
27677	27687	27689	27690	Mr. Beebe	133	“ All the way ? He will be hours , ”
27692	27702	27703	27703	He	200	“ Apparently . I told him it was unwise . ”
28016	28071	28010	28011	Mr. Eager	169	“ Courage , Miss Honeychurch , courage and faith . If I might say so , there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements . Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds , all this immense electrical display , is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me ? ”
28072	28078	28010	28011	Mr. Eager	169	“ No — of course — ”
28079	28135	28010	28011	Mr. Eager	169	“ Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous . The steel knives , the only articles which might attract the current , are in the other carriage . And , in any case , we are infinitely safer than if we were walking . Courage — courage and faith . ”
28221	28225	28227	28228	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Mr. Eager ! ”
28230	28242	28227	28228	Mr. Beebe	133	“ We want your assistance . Will you interpret for us ? ”
28243	28246	28248	28249	Mr. Emerson	126	“ George ! ”
28251	28272	28248	28249	Mr. Emerson	126	“ Ask your driver which way George went . The boy may lose his way . He may be killed . ”
28273	28279	28281	28282	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Go , Mr. Eager , ”
28284	28310	28281	28282	Miss Bartlett	128	“ do n’t ask our driver ; our driver is no help . Go and support poor Mr. Beebe — , he is nearly demented . ”
28311	28317	28319	28321	the old man	360	“ He may be killed ! ”
28323	28329	28319	28321	the old man	360	“ He may be killed ! ”
28330	28334	28336	28337	the chaplain	820	“ Typical behaviour , ”
28345	28359	28340	28340	he	820	“ In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down . ”
28360	28366	28368	28368	Lucy	129	“ What does he know ? ”
28376	28386	28368	28368	Lucy	129	“ Charlotte , how much does Mr. Eager know ? ”
28387	28398	28399	28399	she	128	“ Nothing , dearest ; he knows nothing . But — ”
28403	28416	28417	28417	She	128	driver—“he knows everything . Dearest , had we better ? Shall I ? ”
28423	28441	28420	28420	her	128	“ It is dreadful to be entangled with low - class people . He saw it all . ”
28455	28458	28452	28452	she	128	“ Silenzio ! ”
28465	28469	28470	28470	he	200	“ Va bene , ”
28685	28720	28677	28677	Lucy	129	“ Charlotte , dear Charlotte , kiss me . Kiss me again . Only you can understand me . You warned me to be careful . And I — I thought I was developing . ”
28721	28732	28677	28677	Lucy	129	“ Do not cry , dearest . Take your time . ”
28733	28771	28677	28677	Lucy	129	“ I have been obstinate and silly — worse than you know , far worse . Once by the river — Oh , but he is n’t killed — he would n’t be killed , would he ? ”
28810	28822	28677	28677	Lucy	129	“ I trust not . One would always pray against that . ”
28823	28913	28677	28677	Lucy	129	“ He is really — I think he was taken by surprise , just as I was before . But this time I ’m not to blame ; I want you to believe that . I simply slipped into those violets . No , I want to be really truthful . I am a little to blame . I had silly thoughts . The sky , you know , was gold , and the ground all blue , and for a moment he looked like someone in a book . ”
28914	28919	28677	28677	Lucy	129	“ In a book ? ”
28920	28930	28677	28677	Lucy	129	“ Heroes — gods — the nonsense of schoolgirls . ”
28931	28935	28677	28677	Lucy	129	“ And then ? ”
28936	28947	28677	28677	Lucy	129	“ But , Charlotte , you know what happened then . ”
28995	29002	29003	29003	she	129	“ I want to be truthful , ”
29006	29016	29003	29003	she	129	“ It is so hard to be absolutely truthful . ”
29017	29044	29003	29003	she	129	“ Do n’t be troubled , dearest . Wait till you are calmer . We will talk it over before bed - time in my room . ”
29193	29197	29199	29199	she	129	“ At last , ”
29201	29229	29199	29199	she	129	“ I shall understand myself . I sha n’t again be troubled by things that come out of nothing , and mean I do n’t know what . ”
29338	29368	29331	29331	her	128	“ Well , dear , I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire . Come into my room , and I will give a good brush to your hair . ”
29390	29398	29387	29388	Miss Bartlett	128	“ So what is to be done ? ”
29434	29452	29482	29483	Miss Bartlett	128	“ What is to be done ? A point , dearest , which you alone can settle . ”
29544	29554	29555	29555	she	129	“ It has been raining for nearly four hours , ”
29566	29575	29521	29521	She	129	“ How do you propose to silence him ? ”
29576	29580	29521	29521	She	129	“ The driver ? ”
29581	29592	29521	29521	She	129	“ My dear girl , no ; Mr. George Emerson . ”
29603	29609	29610	29610	she	129	“ I do n’t understand , ”
29630	29642	29521	29521	She	129	“ How are you going to stop him talking about it ? ”
29643	29658	29521	29521	She	129	“ I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do . ”
29659	29687	29521	29521	She	129	“ I , too , intend to judge him charitably . But unfortunately I have met the type before . They seldom keep their exploits to themselves . ”
29688	29691	29693	29693	Lucy	129	“ Exploits ? ”
29701	29757	29521	29521	She	129	“ My poor dear , did you suppose that this was his first ? Come here and listen to me . I am only gathering it from his own remarks . Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another ? ”
29758	29761	29763	29763	Lucy	129	“ Yes , ”
29774	29834	29521	29521	She	129	“ Well , I am no prude . There is no need to call him a wicked young man , but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined . Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education , if you wish . But we are no farther on with our question . What do you propose to do ? ”
29863	29871	29873	29873	she	129	“ I propose to speak to him , ”
29884	29914	29875	29876	Miss Bartlett	128	“ You see , Charlotte , your kindness — I shall never forget it . But — as you said — it is my affair . Mine and his . ”
29915	29931	30062	30062	her	129	“ And you are going to implore him , to beg him to keep silence ? ”
29932	29974	29875	29876	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Certainly not . There would be no difficulty . Whatever you ask him he answers , yes or no ; then it is over . I have been frightened of him . But now I am not one little bit . ”
29975	30048	30062	30062	her	129	“ But we fear him for you , dear . You are so young and inexperienced , you have lived among such nice people , that you can not realize what men can be — how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round . This afternoon , for example , if I had not arrived , what would have happened ? ”
30049	30055	30057	30057	Lucy	129	“ I ca n’t think , ”
30076	30087	30062	30062	her	129	“ What would have happened if I had n’t arrived ? ”
30088	30094	30096	30096	Lucy	129	“ I ca n’t think , ”
30099	30111	30062	30062	her	129	“ When he insulted you , how would you have replied ? ”
30112	30123	30062	30062	her	129	“ I had n’t time to think . You came . ”
30124	30140	30062	30062	her	129	“ Yes , but wo n’t you tell me now what you would have done ? ”
30141	30146	30147	30147	She	129	“ I should have — ”
30182	30191	30193	30194	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Come away from the window , dear , ”
30196	30205	30193	30194	Miss Bartlett	128	“ You will be seen from the road . ”
30265	30345	30260	30261	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Oh , for a real man ! We are only two women , you and I. Mr. Beebe is hopeless . There is Mr. Eager , but you do not trust him . Oh , for your brother ! He is young , but I know that his sister ’s insult would rouse in him a very lion . Thank God , chivalry is not yet dead . There are still left some men who can reverence woman . ”
30379	30396	30371	30371	she	128	“ It will be a push to catch the morning train , but we must try . ”
30397	30401	30371	30371	she	128	“ What train ? ”
30402	30408	30409	30409	She	128	“ The train to Rome . ”
30429	30438	30371	30371	she	128	“ When does the train to Rome go ? ”
30439	30443	30409	30409	She	128	“ At eight . ”
30444	30451	30371	30371	she	128	“ Signora Bertolini would be upset . ”
30452	30458	30460	30461	Miss Bartlett	128	“ We must face that , ”
30474	30487	30371	30371	she	128	“ She will make us pay for a whole week ’s pension . ”
30488	30517	30371	30371	she	128	“ I expect she will . However , we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses ’ hotel . Is n’t afternoon tea given there for nothing ? ”
30518	30528	30532	30532	she	128	“ Yes , but they pay extra for wine . ”
30809	30820	30801	30801	she	128	“ Dearest Lucy , how will you ever forgive me ? ”
30854	30871	30851	30851	she	129	“ Charlotte dear , what do you mean ? As if I have anything to forgive ! ”
30872	30904	30851	30851	she	129	“ You have a great deal , and I have a very great deal to forgive myself , too . I know well how much I vex you at every turn . ”
30905	30909	30851	30851	she	129	“ But no — ”
30924	30984	30851	30851	she	129	“ Ah , but yes ! I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped . I might have known it would not do . You want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you . I am too uninteresting and old - fashioned — only fit to pack and unpack your things . ”
30985	30988	30851	30851	she	129	“ Please — ”
30989	31055	30851	30851	she	129	“ My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste , and were often able to leave me at home . I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do , but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary . You had your own way about these rooms , at all events . ”
31056	31064	31066	31066	Lucy	129	“ You must n’t say these things , ”
31094	31101	31107	31107	she	128	“ I have been a failure , ”
31122	31155	31107	31107	she	128	“ Failed to make you happy ; failed in my duty to your mother . She has been so generous to me ; I shall never face her again after this disaster . ”
31156	31179	31107	31107	she	128	“ But mother will understand . It is not your fault , this trouble , and it is n’t a disaster either . ”
31180	31214	31107	31107	she	128	“ It is my fault , it is a disaster . She will never forgive me , and rightly . For instance , what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish ? ”
31215	31219	31107	31107	she	128	“ Every right . ”
31220	31260	31107	31107	she	128	“ When I was here for your sake ? If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you . Your mother will see this as clearly as I do , when you tell her . ”
31274	31282	31261	31261	Lucy	129	“ Why need mother hear of it ? ”
31283	31290	31107	31107	she	128	“ But you tell her everything ? ”
31291	31298	31261	31261	Lucy	129	“ I suppose I do generally . ”
31299	31328	31107	31107	she	128	“ I dare not break your confidence . There is something sacred in it . Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her . ”
31338	31384	31261	31261	Lucy	129	“ Naturally I should have told her . But in case she should blame you in any way , I promise I will not , I am very willing not to . I will never speak of it either to her or to any one . ”
31813	31831	31809	31809	her	128	“ I wish one word with you in the drawing - room , Mr. Emerson , please . ”
31842	31850	31838	31839	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Good - night , Mr. Emerson . ”
31872	31899	31868	31868	Lucy	129	“ It is n’t true . It ca n’t all be true . I want not to be muddled . I want to grow older quickly . ”
31907	31925	31900	31901	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Go to bed at once , dear . You need all the rest you can get . ”
32000	32010	31989	31990	A poet	1123	“ Life like a dome of many coloured glass , ”
32174	32180	32182	32183	the boy	772	“ Where are n’t they ? ”
32193	32203	32182	32183	the boy	772	“ I tell you I ’m getting fairly sick . ”
32204	32219	32221	32222	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ For goodness ’ sake go out of my drawing - room , then ? ”
32244	32254	32255	32255	she	134	“ I think things are coming to a head , ”
32276	32281	32255	32255	she	134	“ Time they did . ”
32282	32295	32255	32255	she	134	“ I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more . ”
32296	32307	32255	32255	she	134	“ It ’s his third go , is n’t it ? ”
32308	32319	32255	32255	she	134	“ Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind . ”
32320	32329	32331	32331	he	135	“ I did n’t mean to be unkind . ”
32334	32398	32331	32331	he	135	“ But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy . I do n’t know how girls manage things , but she ca n’t have said ‘ No ’ properly before , or she would n’t have to say it again now . Over the whole thing — I ca n’t explain — I do feel so uncomfortable . ”
32399	32409	32255	32255	she	134	“ Do you indeed , dear ? How interesting ! ”
32410	32417	32331	32331	he	135	“ I feel — never mind . ”
32424	32445	32255	32255	she	134	“ Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse . I said : ‘ Dear Mrs. Vyse . ’ ”
32446	32460	32255	32255	she	134	“ Yes , mother , you told me . A jolly good letter . ”
32461	32493	32494	32494	She	1134	“ I said : ‘ Dear Mrs. Vyse , Cecil has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted , if Lucy wishes it . But — ’ ”
32498	32542	32494	32494	She	1134	“ I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all . He has always gone in for unconventionality , and parents nowhere , and so forth . When it comes to the point , he ca n’t get on without me . ”
32543	32547	32255	32255	she	134	“ Nor me . ”
32548	32551	32494	32494	She	1134	“ You ? ”
32555	32561	32552	32552	Freddy	135	“ What do you mean ? ”
32562	32571	32255	32255	she	134	“ He asked me for my permission also . ”
32575	32582	32572	32572	She	1134	“ How very odd of him ! ”
32583	32587	32589	32592	the son and heir	1135	“ Why so ? ”
32594	32603	32572	32572	She	1134	“ Why should n’t my permission be asked ? ”
32604	32622	32255	32255	she	134	“ What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything ? What ever did you say ? ”
32623	32644	32572	32572	She	1134	“ I said to Cecil , ‘ Take her or leave her ; it ’s no business of mine ! ’ ”
32645	32651	32255	32255	she	134	“ What a helpful answer ! ”
32671	32677	32679	32679	Freddy	135	“ The bother is this , ”
32706	32718	32698	32699	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Freddy , you must come . There they still are ! ”
32719	32732	32750	32750	she	1134	“ I do n’t see you ought to go peeping like that . ”
32733	32748	32698	32699	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Peeping like that ! Ca n’t I look out of my own window ? ”
32766	32771	32750	32750	she	1134	“ Still page 322 ? ”
32807	32825	32826	32826	He	135	“ The bother is this : I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully . ”
32832	32918	32826	32826	He	135	“ Not content with ‘ permission ’ , which I did give — that is to say , I said , ‘ I do n’t mind’—well , not content with that , he wanted to know whether I was n’t off my head with joy . He practically put it like this : Was n’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her ? And he would have an answer — he said it would strengthen his hand . ”
32919	32930	32986	32987	his mother	1129	“ I hope you gave a careful answer , dear . ”
32931	32937	32939	32940	the boy	772	“ I answered ‘ No ’ ”
32946	32979	32939	32940	the boy	772	“ There ! Fly into a stew ! I ca n’t help it — had to say it . I had to say no . He ought never to have asked me . ”
32980	32984	32986	32987	his mother	1129	“ Ridiculous child ! ”
32989	33038	32986	32987	his mother	1129	“ You think you ’re so holy and truthful , but really it ’s only abominable conceit . Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say ? I hope he boxed your ears . How dare you say no ? ”
33039	33116	32939	32940	the boy	772	“ Oh , do keep quiet , mother ! I had to say no when I could n’t say yes . I tried to laugh as if I did n’t mean what I said , and , as Cecil laughed too , and went away , it may be all right . But I feel my foot ’s in it . Oh , do keep quiet , though , and let a man do some work . ”
33117	33120	33122	33123	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ No , ”
33136	33179	33122	33123	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ I shall not keep quiet . You know all that has passed between them in Rome ; you know why he is down here , and yet you deliberately insult him , and try to turn him out of my house . ”
33180	33185	33186	33186	he	1141	“ Not a bit ! ”
33189	33223	33186	33186	he	1141	“ I only let out I did n’t like him . I do n’t hate him , but I do n’t like him . What I mind is that he ’ll tell Lucy . ”
33231	33238	33240	33241	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Well , I like him , ”
33243	33293	33294	33294	She	134	“ I know his mother ; he ’s good , he ’s clever , he ’s rich , he ’s well connected — Oh , you need n’t kick the piano ! He ’s well connected — I’ll say it again if you like : he ’s well connected . ”
33312	33319	33309	33309	She	134	“ And he has beautiful manners . ”
33320	33355	33294	33294	She	134	“ I liked him till just now . I suppose it ’s having him spoiling Lucy ’s first week at home ; and it ’s also something that Mr. Beebe said , not knowing . ”
33356	33360	33368	33368	her	1129	“ Mr. Beebe ? ”
33371	33382	33368	33368	her	1129	“ I do n’t see how Mr. Beebe comes in . ”
33383	33475	33362	33363	his mother	1129	“ You know Mr. Beebe ’s funny way , when you never quite know what he means . He said : ‘ Mr. Vyse is an ideal bachelor . ’ I was very cute , I asked him what he meant . He said ‘ Oh , he ’s like me — better detached . ’ I could n’t make him say any more , but it set me thinking . Since Cecil has come after Lucy he has n’t been so pleasant , at least — I ca n’t explain . ”
33476	33502	33368	33368	her	1129	“ You never can , dear . But I can . You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties . ”
33602	33607	33609	33610	his mother	1129	“ Will this do ? ”
33612	33746	33609	33610	his mother	1129	“ ‘ Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it . ’ Then I put in at the top , ‘ and I have told Lucy so . ’ I must write the letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so . But Lucy seems very uncertain , and in these days young people must decide for themselves . ’ I said that because I did n’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old - fashioned . She goes in for lectures and improving her mind , and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds , and the maid ’s dirty thumb - marks where you turn on the electric light . She keeps that flat abominably — ”
33747	33765	33585	33585	He	135	“ Suppose Lucy marries Cecil , would she live in a flat , or in the country ? ”
33766	33848	33609	33610	his mother	1129	“ Do n’t interrupt so foolishly . Where was I ? Oh yes—‘Young people must decide for themselves . I know that Lucy likes your son , because she tells me everything , and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first . ’ No , I ’ll cross that last bit out — it looks patronizing . I ’ll stop at ‘ because she tells me everything . ’ Or shall I cross that out , too ? ”
33849	33856	33858	33858	Freddy	135	“ Cross it out , too , ”
33866	33940	33609	33610	his mother	1129	“ Then the whole thing runs : ‘ Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it , and I have told Lucy so . But Lucy seems very uncertain , and in these days young people must decide for themselves . I know that Lucy likes your son , because she tells me everything . But I do not know — ’ ”
33941	33945	33947	33947	Freddy	135	“ Look out ! ”
34263	34268	34269	34269	she	134	“ Oh , Cecil ! ”
34270	34278	34247	34248	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	exclaimed—“oh , Cecil , do tell me ! ”
34279	34284	34286	34286	he	256	“ I promessi sposi , ”
34294	34300	34301	34301	he	256	“ She has accepted me , ”
34325	34331	34333	34334	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ I am so glad , ”
34395	34403	34405	34406	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Welcome as one of the family ! ”
34415	34435	34409	34409	her	134	“ This is indeed a joyous day ! I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy . ”
34436	34441	34443	34445	the young man	393	“ I hope so , ”
34454	34458	34460	34461	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ We mothers — ”
34506	34512	34514	34514	Cecil	256	“ I say , Lucy ! ”
34575	34579	34572	34572	He	881	“ Steady on ! ”
34580	34587	34589	34590	her mother	493	“ Not a kiss for me ? ”
34597	34613	34614	34614	Cecil	256	“ Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it ? ”
34617	34628	34614	34614	Cecil	256	“ And I ’d stop here and tell my mother . ”
34629	34635	34637	34637	Freddy	135	“ We go with Lucy ? ”
34644	34652	34614	34614	Cecil	256	“ Yes , you go with Lucy . ”
34907	34910	34911	34911	She	222	“ story . ”
35191	35196	35181	35181	he	256	“ Dear Mrs. Vyse , ”
35415	35421	35422	35422	he	256	Freddy—“He is only a boy , ”
35425	35446	35422	35422	he	256	“ I represent all that he despises . Why should he want me for a brother - in - law ? ”
35491	35495	35497	35498	the maid	2704	“ Mr. Beebe ! ”
35539	35558	35533	35533	Cecil	256	“ I ’ve come for tea , Mr. Vyse . Do you suppose that I shall get it ? ”
35559	35589	35533	35533	Cecil	256	“ I should say so . Food is the thing one does get here — Don’t sit in that chair ; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it . ”
35590	35593	35533	35533	Cecil	256	“ Pfui ! ”
35594	35598	35600	35600	Cecil	256	“ I know , ”
35602	35616	35600	35600	Cecil	256	“ I know . I ca n’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it . ”
35649	35664	35533	35533	Cecil	256	“ I ’ve come for tea and for gossip . Is n’t this news ? ”
35665	35674	35676	35676	Cecil	256	“ News ? I do n’t understand you , ”
35678	35681	35676	35676	Cecil	256	“ News ? ”
35697	35732	35682	35683	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up ; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field . He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack ! ”
35733	35738	35740	35740	Cecil	256	“ Has he indeed ? ”
35802	35845	35799	35800	a bounder	1198	“ Unpardonable question ! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert , the semi - detached villas that have been run up opposite the church ! I ’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you . ”
35846	35855	35857	35859	the young man	393	“ I ’m shockingly stupid over local affairs , ”
35862	35935	35857	35859	the young man	393	“ I ca n’t even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board . Perhaps there is no difference , or perhaps those are n’t the right names . I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery . It is very remiss of me . Italy and London are the only places where I do n’t feel to exist on sufferance . ”
35955	35971	35799	35800	a bounder	1198	“ Let me see , Mr. Vyse — I forget — what is your profession ? ”
35972	35978	35980	35980	Cecil	256	“ I have no profession , ”
35982	36057	35980	35980	Cecil	256	“ It is another example of my decadence . My attitude — quite an indefensible one — is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like . I know I ought to be getting money out of people , or devoting myself to things I do n’t care a straw about , but somehow , I ’ve not been able to begin . ”
36058	36064	36066	36067	Mr. Beebe	133	“ You are very fortunate , ”
36069	36081	36066	36067	Mr. Beebe	133	“ It is a wonderful opportunity , the possession of leisure . ”
36119	36141	36082	36082	His	133	“ I am glad that you approve . I dare n’t face the healthy person — for example , Freddy Honeychurch . ”
36142	36155	36100	36100	He	133	“ Oh , Freddy ’s a good sort , is n’t he ? ”
36156	36169	36082	36082	His	133	“ Admirable . The sort who has made England what she is . ”
36235	36241	36243	36244	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Where are the others ? ”
36248	36258	36243	36244	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I insist on extracting tea before evening service . ”
36259	36336	36216	36216	he	256	“ I suppose Anne never told them you were here . In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives . The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly , and kicks the chair - legs with her feet . The faults of Mary — I forget the faults of Mary , but they are very grave . Shall we look in the garden ? ”
36337	36356	36243	36244	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I know the faults of Mary . She leaves the dust - pans standing on the stairs . ”
36357	36378	36216	36216	he	256	“ The fault of Euphemia is that she will not , simply will not , chop the suet sufficiently small . ”
36390	36396	36397	36397	Cecil	256	“ The faults of Freddy — ”
36400	36432	36397	36397	Cecil	256	“ Ah , he has too many . No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy . Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch ; they are not innumerable . ”
36433	36438	36440	36442	the young man	393	“ She has none , ”
36448	36459	36243	36244	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I quite agree . At present she has none . ”
36460	36464	36397	36397	Cecil	256	“ At present ? ”
36465	36551	36243	36244	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I ’m not cynical . I ’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch . Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully , and live so quietly ? I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both . The water - tight compartments in her will break down , and music and life will mingle . Then we shall have her heroically good , heroically bad — too heroic , perhaps , to be good or bad . ”
36558	36573	36397	36397	Cecil	256	“ And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes ? ”
36574	36658	36243	36244	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Well , I must say I ’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells , where she was not wonderful , and at Florence . Since I came to Summer Street she has been away . You saw her , did n’t you , at Rome and in the Alps . Oh , I forgot ; of course , you knew her before . No , she was n’t wonderful in Florence either , but I kept on expecting that she would be . ”
36659	36664	36397	36397	Cecil	256	“ In what way ? ”
36682	36745	36673	36673	they	1209	“ I could as easily tell you what tune she ’ll play next . There was simply the sense that she had found wings , and meant to use them . I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary : Miss Honeychurch as a kite , Miss Bartlett holding the string . Picture number two : the string breaks . ”
36779	36786	36769	36769	he	1211	“ But the string never broke ? ”
36787	36809	36750	36750	his	1211	“ No . I might n’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise , but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall . ”
36810	36816	36818	36820	the young man	393	“ It has broken now , ”
36874	36882	36857	36857	he	393	“ Broken ? What do you mean ? ”
36883	36887	36889	36889	Cecil	256	“ I meant , ”
36892	36901	36889	36889	Cecil	256	“ that she is going to marry me . ”
36920	36962	36967	36967	he	380	“ I am sorry ; I must apologize . I had no idea you were intimate with her , or I should never have talked in this flippant , superficial way . Mr. Vyse , you ought to have stopped me . ”
37052	37063	37064	37064	he	256	“ I am sorry I have given you a shock , ”
37068	37082	37064	37064	he	256	“ I fear that Lucy ’s choice does not meet with your approval . ”
37083	37125	37064	37064	he	256	“ Not that . But you ought to have stopped me . I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes . Perhaps I ought n’t to have discussed her so freely with any one ; certainly not with you . ”
37126	37136	37064	37064	he	256	“ You are conscious of having said something indiscreet ? ”
37170	37256	37262	37262	him	219	“ No , I have said nothing indiscreet . I foresaw at Florence that her quiet , uneventful childhood must end , and it has ended . I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step . She has taken it . She has learnt — you will let me talk freely , as I have begun freely — she has learnt what it is to love : the greatest lesson , some people will tell you , that our earthly life provides . ”
37280	37287	37290	37290	his	219	“ She has learnt through you , ”
37302	37316	37290	37290	his	219	“ let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her . ”
37317	37321	37323	37323	Cecil	256	“ Grazie tante ! ”
37331	37336	37341	37341	she	134	“ Have you heard ? ”
37348	37360	37341	37341	she	134	“ Oh , Mr. Beebe , have you heard the news ? ”
37380	37385	37386	37386	he	135	“ Indeed I have ! ”
37413	37486	37397	37397	he	135	“ Mrs. Honeychurch , I ’m going to do what I am always supposed to do , but generally I ’m too shy . I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them , grave and gay , great and small . I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife , as father and mother . And now I want my tea . ”
37487	37497	37498	37499	the lady	1221	“ You only asked for it just in time , ”
37502	37512	37498	37499	the lady	1221	“ How dare you be serious at Windy Corner ? ”
37807	37808	37796	37796	Freddy	135	“ Fiasco”—family
38063	38075	38076	38076	he	256	“ Do you go to much of this sort of thing ? ”
38084	38091	38093	38093	Lucy	129	“ Oh , now and then , ”
38101	38109	38076	38076	he	256	“ Is it typical of country society ? ”
38110	38121	38147	38147	her	134	“ I suppose so . Mother , would it be ? ”
38122	38127	38129	38130	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Plenty of society , ”
38159	38171	38152	38152	Cecil	256	“ To me it seemed perfectly appalling , disastrous , portentous . ”
38172	38182	38147	38147	her	134	“ I am so sorry that you were stranded . ”
38183	38226	38152	38152	Cecil	256	“ Not that , but the congratulations . It is so disgusting , the way an engagement is regarded as public property — a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment . All those old women smirking ! ”
38227	38248	38147	38147	her	134	“ One has to go through it , I suppose . They wo n’t notice us so much next time . ”
38249	38283	38152	38152	Cecil	256	“ But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong . An engagement — horrid word in the first place — is a private matter , and should be treated as such . ”
38353	38357	38358	38358	she	129	“ How tiresome ! ”
38361	38370	38358	38358	she	129	“ Could n’t you have escaped to tennis ? ”
38371	38409	38427	38427	She	129	“ I do n’t play tennis — at least , not in public . The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic . Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato . ”
38410	38414	38358	38358	she	129	“ Inglese Italianato ? ”
38415	38426	38427	38427	She	129	“ E un diavolo incarnato ! You know the proverb ? ”
38473	38476	38478	38478	he	256	“ Well , ”
38480	38509	38478	38478	he	256	“ I can not help it if they do disapprove of me . There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them , and I must accept them . ”
38510	38520	38522	38523	wise Lucy	129	“ We all have our limitations , I suppose , ”
38525	38535	38537	38537	Cecil	256	“ Sometimes they are forced on us , though , ”
38553	38556	38478	38478	he	256	“ How ? ”
38557	38585	38545	38545	she	129	“ It makes a difference does n’t it , whether we fully fence ourselves in , or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others ? ”
38600	38603	38605	38606	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Difference ? ”
38611	38632	38605	38606	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ I do n’t see any difference . Fences are fences , especially when they are in the same place . ”
38633	38640	38642	38642	Cecil	256	“ We were speaking of motives , ”
38650	38658	38659	38659	She	129	“ My dear Cecil , look here . ”
38674	38706	38659	38659	She	129	“ This is me . That ’s Windy Corner . The rest of the pattern is the other people . Motives are all very well , but the fence comes here . ”
38707	38716	38718	38718	Lucy	129	“ We were n’t talking of real fences , ”
38722	38732	38659	38659	She	129	“ Oh , I see , dear — poetry . ”
38746	38762	38763	38763	she	129	“ I tell you who has no ‘ fences , ’ as you call them , ”
38766	38773	38763	38763	she	129	“ and that ’s Mr. Beebe . ”
38774	38784	38785	38785	Lucy	129	“ A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless . ”
38817	38825	38826	38826	she	129	“ Do n’t you like Mr. Beebe ? ”
38830	38836	38837	38837	he	256	“ I never said so ! ”
38840	38853	38837	38837	he	256	“ I consider him far above the average . I only denied — ”
38869	38879	38881	38881	she	129	“ Now , a clergyman that I do hate , ”
38888	38940	38881	38881	she	129	“ a clergyman that does have fences , and the most dreadful ones , is Mr. Eager , the English chaplain at Florence . He was truly insincere — not merely the manner unfortunate . He was a snob , and so conceited , and he did say such unkind things . ”
38941	38947	39058	39059	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ What sort of things ? ”
38948	38965	38881	38881	she	129	“ There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife . ”
38966	38971	39058	39059	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Perhaps he had . ”
38972	38975	38881	38881	she	129	“ No ! ”
38976	38982	39058	39059	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Why ‘ no ’ ? ”
38983	38996	38881	38881	she	129	“ He was such a nice old man , I ’m sure . ”
39004	39050	39058	39059	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Well , I did try to sift the thing . Mr. Eager would never come to the point . He prefers it vague — said the old man had ‘ practically ’ murdered his wife — had murdered her in the sight of God . ”
39051	39056	39058	39059	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Hush , dear ! ”
39062	39113	39058	39059	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ But is n’t it intolerable that a person whom we ’re told to imitate should go round spreading slander ? It was , I believe , chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped . People pretended he was vulgar , but he certainly was n’t that . ”
39114	39124	39058	39059	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Poor old man ! What was his name ? ”
39125	39128	39130	39130	Lucy	129	“ Harris , ”
39133	39146	39148	39149	her mother	493	“ Let ’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person , ”
39155	39167	39168	39168	he	256	“ Is n’t Mr. Eager a parson of the cultured type ? ”
39171	39204	39215	39216	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ I do n’t know . I hate him . I ’ve heard him lecture on Giotto . I hate him . Nothing can hide a petty nature . I hate him . ”
39205	39213	39215	39216	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ My goodness gracious me , child ! ”
39218	39244	39215	39216	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ You ’ll blow my head off ! Whatever is there to shout over ? I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen . ”
39437	39445	39446	39446	he	1255	“ I count myself a lucky person , ”
39449	39578	39446	39446	he	1255	“ When I ’m in London I feel I could never live out of it . When I ’m in the country I feel the same about the country . After all , I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life , and that the people who live amongst them must be the best . It ’s true that in nine cases out of ten they do n’t seem to notice anything . The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions . Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town . Do you feel that , Mrs. Honeychurch ? ”
39663	39677	39678	39678	he	256	“ ‘ Come down , O maid , from yonder mountain height , ’ ”
39695	39699	39689	39689	She	129	“ What height ? ”
39700	39734	39689	39689	She	129	“ ‘ Come down , O maid , from yonder mountain height , What pleasure lives in height ( the shepherd sang ) . In height and in the splendour of the hills ? ’
39753	39753	39689	39689	She	129	”
39754	39761	39763	39763	Lucy	129	“ Summer Street , of course , ”
39899	39901	39897	39897	Cecil	256	“ Cissie ”
39911	39913	39897	39897	Cecil	256	“ Albert ”
39956	39958	39962	39962	His	156	“ Albert ”
39985	39987	40039	40040	the ladies	348	“ Cissie ”
40031	40037	40039	40040	the ladies	348	“ The place is ruined ! ”
40043	40053	40039	40040	the ladies	348	“ Summer Street will never be the same again . ”
40059	40062	40072	40072	her	129	“ Cissie ’s ”
40074	40077	40079	40080	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Stop ! ”
40089	40110	40079	40080	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Here ’s Sir Harry . Now we shall know . Sir Harry , pull those things down at once ! ”
40127	40148	40111	40113	Sir Harry Otway	156	“ Mrs. Honeychurch , I meant to . I ca n’t , I really ca n’t turn out Miss Flack . ”
40149	40183	40194	40194	his	156	“ Am I not always right ? She ought to have gone before the contract was signed . Does she still live rent free , as she did in her nephew ’s time ? ”
40184	40191	40192	40192	He	156	“ But what can I do ? ”
40197	40210	40194	40194	his	156	“ An old lady , so very vulgar , and almost bedridden . ”
40211	40216	40218	40218	Cecil	256	“ Turn her out , ”
40413	40445	40400	40401	Mr. Flack	230	“ and all the capitals different — one with dragons in the foliage , another approaching to the Ionian style , another introducing Mrs. Flack ’s initials — every one different . ”
40551	40552	40617	40618	Sir Harry	156	“ Cissie”—someone
40556	40563	40564	40564	he	156	“ The rent is absurdly low , ”
40568	40604	40564	40564	he	156	“ and perhaps I am an easy landlord . But it is such an awkward size . It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves . ”
40631	40641	40642	40642	he	156	“ You ought to find a tenant at once , ”
40646	40658	40642	40642	he	156	“ It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk . ”
40659	40662	40664	40665	Sir Harry	156	“ Exactly ! ”
40668	40716	40664	40665	Sir Harry	156	“ That is exactly what I fear , Mr. Vyse . It will attract the wrong type of people . The train service has improved — a fatal improvement , to my mind . And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles ? ”
40717	40726	40728	40728	Lucy	129	“ Rather a strenuous clerk it would be , ”
40776	40780	40781	40781	she	129	“ Sir Harry ! ”
40784	40796	40781	40781	she	129	“ I have an idea . How would you like spinsters ? ”
40797	40813	40758	40758	She	129	“ My dear Lucy , it would be splendid . Do you know any such ? ”
40814	40822	40781	40781	she	129	“ Yes ; I met them abroad . ”
40823	40826	40827	40827	he	156	“ Gentlewomen ? ”
40831	40886	40781	40781	she	129	“ Yes , indeed , and at the present moment homeless . I heard from them last week — Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan . I ’m really not joking . They are quite the right people . Mr. Beebe knows them , too . May I tell them to write to you ? ”
40887	40892	40893	40893	he	156	“ Indeed you may ! ”
40896	41038	40893	40893	he	156	“ Here we are with the difficulty solved already . How delightful it is ! Extra facilities — please tell them they shall have extra facilities , for I shall have no agents ’ fees . Oh , the agents ! The appalling people they have sent me ! One woman , when I wrote — a tactful letter , you know — asking her to explain her social position to me , replied that she would pay the rent in advance . As if one cares about that ! And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory — people swindlers , or not respectable . And oh , the deceit ! I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week . The deceit of the most promising people . My dear Lucy , the deceit ! ”
41042	41046	41049	41050	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ My advice , ”
41052	41125	41049	41050	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all . I know the type . Preserve me from people who have seen better days , and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy . It ’s a sad thing , but I ’d far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down . ”
41126	41133	41135	41136	Sir Harry	156	“ I think I follow you , ”
41138	41152	41135	41136	Sir Harry	156	“ but it is , as you say , a very sad thing . ”
41153	41161	41163	41163	Lucy	129	“ The Misses Alan are n’t that ! ”
41165	41171	41173	41173	Cecil	256	“ Yes , they are , ”
41175	41195	41173	41173	Cecil	256	“ I have n’t met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood . ”
41196	41210	41049	41050	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Do n’t listen to him , Sir Harry — he ’s tiresome . ”
41211	41219	41220	41220	he	156	“ It ’s I who am tiresome , ”
41223	41267	41220	41220	he	156	“ I ought n’t to come with my troubles to young people . But really I am so worried , and Lady Otway will only say that I can not be too careful , which is quite true , but no real help . ”
41268	41278	41049	41050	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Then may I write to my Misses Alan ? ”
41279	41282	41220	41220	he	156	“ Please ! ”
41292	41337	41288	41289	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Beware ! They are certain to have canaries . Sir Harry , beware of canaries : they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come . Beware of women altogether . Only let to a man . ”
41338	41341	41342	41342	he	156	“ Really — ”
41355	41417	41352	41352	her	134	“ Men do n’t gossip over tea - cups . If they get drunk , there ’s an end of them — they lie down comfortably and sleep it off . If they ’re vulgar , they somehow keep it to themselves . It does n’t spread so . Give me a man — of course , provided he ’s clean . ”
41465	41467	41447	41447	He	156	“ Cissie ”
41515	41519	41520	41520	he	256	“ Mrs. Honeychurch , ”
41523	41534	41520	41520	he	256	“ what if we two walk home and leave you ? ”
41535	41538	41540	41540	her	134	“ Certainly ! ”
41565	41574	41557	41557	He	156	“ Aha ! young people , young people ! ”
41583	41587	41589	41589	Cecil	256	“ Hopeless vulgarian ! ”
41599	41604	41557	41557	He	156	“ Oh , Cecil ! ”
41605	41622	41557	41557	He	156	“ I ca n’t help it . It would be wrong not to loathe that man . ”
41623	41635	41557	41557	He	156	“ He is n’t clever , but really he is nice . ”
41636	41710	41557	41557	He	156	“ No , Lucy , he stands for all that is bad in country life . In London he would keep his place . He would belong to a brainless club , and his wife would give brainless dinner parties . But down here he acts the little god with his gentility , and his patronage , and his sham aesthetics , and every one — even your mother — is taken in . ”
41711	41720	41722	41722	Lucy	129	“ All that you say is quite true , ”
41729	41741	41722	41722	Lucy	129	“ I wonder whether — whether it matters so very much . ”
41742	41810	41812	41812	Lucy	129	“ It matters supremely . Sir Harry is the essence of that garden - party . Oh , goodness , how cross I feel ! How I do hope he ’ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa — some woman so really vulgar that he ’ll notice it . Gentlefolks ! Ugh ! with his bald head and retreating chin ! But let ’s forget him . ”
41870	41879	41863	41863	Cecil	256	“ It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy ”
41941	41948	41949	41949	she	129	“ Which way shall we go ? ”
41986	41992	41975	41975	she	129	“ Are there two ways ? ”
41993	42008	41975	41975	she	129	“ Perhaps the road is more sensible , as we ’re got up smart . ”
42009	42018	42020	42020	Cecil	256	“ I ’d rather go through the wood , ”
42036	42072	42020	42020	Cecil	256	“ Why is it , Lucy , that you always say the road ? Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged ? ”
42073	42083	42085	42085	Lucy	129	“ Have n’t I ? The wood , then , ”
42139	42163	42116	42116	She	129	“ I had got an idea — I dare say wrongly — that you feel more at home with me in a room . ”
42164	42168	42169	42169	she	129	“ A room ? ”
42175	42201	42116	42116	She	129	“ Yes . Or , at the most , in a garden , or on a road . Never in the real country like this . ”
42202	42235	42116	42116	She	129	“ Oh , Cecil , whatever do you mean ? I have never felt anything of the sort . You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person . ”
42236	42269	42116	42116	She	129	“ I do n’t know that you are n’t . I connect you with a view — a certain type of view . Why should n’t you connect me with a room ? ”
42281	42317	42270	42270	She	129	“ Do you know that you ’re right ? I do . I must be a poetess after all . When I think of you it ’s always as in a room . How funny ! ”
42326	42338	42270	42270	She	129	“ A drawing - room , pray ? With no view ? ”
42339	42352	42270	42270	She	129	“ Yes , with no view , I fancy . Why not ? ”
42353	42358	42359	42359	he	1320	“ I ’d rather , ”
42363	42373	42359	42359	he	1320	“ that you connected me with the open air . ”
42378	42388	42374	42374	She	129	“ Oh , Cecil , whatever do you mean ? ”
42515	42520	42512	42512	She	129	“ The Sacred Lake ! ”
42521	42529	42512	42512	She	129	“ Why do you call it that ? ”
42530	42606	42512	42512	She	129	“ I ca n’t remember why . I suppose it comes out of some book . It ’s only a puddle now , but you see that stream going through it ? Well , a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains , and ca n’t get away at once , and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful . Then Freddy used to bathe there . He is very fond of it . ”
42607	42611	42612	42612	He	135	“ And you ? ”
42615	42622	42612	42612	He	135	“ Are you fond of it ? ”
42628	42647	42624	42624	she	129	“ I bathed here , too , till I was found out . Then there was a row . ”
42736	42742	42711	42711	she	129	“ Who found you out ? ”
42743	42746	42747	42747	she	129	“ Charlotte , ”
42750	42761	42747	42747	she	129	“ She was stopping with us . Charlotte — Charlotte . ”
42762	42766	42711	42711	she	129	“ Poor girl ! ”
42786	42789	42747	42747	she	129	“ Lucy ! ”
42790	42801	42803	42803	her	129	“ Yes , I suppose we ought to be going , ”
42806	42823	42747	42747	she	129	“ Lucy , I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before . ”
42839	42844	42831	42831	she	129	“ What , Cecil ? ”
42845	42863	42864	42864	He	135	“ Hitherto never — not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me — ”
42885	42888	42831	42831	she	129	“ Yes ? ”
42889	42899	42900	42900	She	129	“ Up to now I have never kissed you . ”
42914	42921	42922	42922	she	129	“ No — more you have , ”
42925	42935	42831	42831	she	129	“ Then I ask you — may I now ? ”
42936	42959	42972	42972	Her	129	“ Of course , you may , Cecil . You might before . I ca n’t run at you , you know . ”
43189	43198	43181	43181	she	129	“ Emerson was the name , not Harris . ”
43199	43203	43181	43181	she	129	“ What name ? ”
43204	43210	43181	43181	she	129	“ The old man ’s . ”
43211	43216	43181	43181	she	129	“ What old man ? ”
43217	43235	43181	43181	she	129	“ That old man I told you about . The one Mr. Eager was so unkind to . ”
43433	43443	43444	43444	she	2533	“ I can not think what people are doing , ”
43448	43458	43444	43444	she	2533	“ but it is extremely fortunate for the children . ”
43794	43801	43802	43802	he	256	“ Does that very much matter ? ”
44030	44058	44017	44017	she	129	“ Oh , it has been such a nuisance — first he , then they — no one knowing what they wanted , and everyone so tiresome . ”
44059	44067	44069	44070	Mr. Beebe	133	“ But they really are coming now , ”
44072	44115	44069	44070	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago — she was wondering how often the butcher called , and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably . They are coming . I heard from them this morning .
44116	44124	44125	44126	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ I shall hate those Miss Alans ! ”
44129	44172	44125	44126	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Just because they ’re old and silly one ’s expected to say ‘ How sweet ! ’ I hate their ‘ if’-ing and ‘ but’-ing and ‘ and’-ing . And poor Lucy — serve her right — worn to a shadow . ”
44203	44218	44219	44219	Saturn	249	“ Well , if they are coming — No , Minnie , not Saturn . ”
44242	44298	44234	44234	his	249	“ If they are coming , Sir Harry will let them move in before the twenty - ninth , and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings , because it made them nervous , and put in the fair wear and tear one.—That does n’t count . I told you not Saturn . ”
44299	44309	44311	44311	Freddy	135	“ Saturn ’s all right for bumble - puppy , ”
44316	44326	44311	44311	Freddy	135	“ Minnie , do n’t you listen to her . ”
44327	44333	44234	44234	his	249	“ Saturn does n’t bounce . ”
44334	44339	44311	44311	Freddy	135	“ Saturn bounces enough . ”
44340	44347	44234	44234	his	249	“ No , he does n’t . ”
44348	44360	44311	44311	Freddy	135	“ Well ; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil . ”
44361	44366	44368	44369	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Hush , dear , ”
44371	44426	44368	44369	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ But look at Lucy — complaining of Saturn , and all the time ’s got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand , ready to plug it in . That ’s right , Minnie , go for her — get her over the shins with the racquet — get her over the shins ! ”
44448	44460	44439	44440	Mr. Beebe	133	“ The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona , please . ”
44573	44583	44585	44586	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I wish the Miss Alans could see this , ”
44610	44617	44618	44618	Freddy	135	“ Who are the Miss Alans ? ”
44621	44628	44618	44618	Freddy	135	“ They have taken Cissie Villa . ”
44629	44636	44618	44618	Freddy	135	“ That was n’t the name — ”
44657	44663	44665	44665	Lucy	129	“ Was n’t what name ? ”
44676	44691	44618	44618	Freddy	135	“ Alan was n’t the name of the people Sir Harry ’s let to . ”
44692	44703	44618	44618	Freddy	135	“ Nonsense , Freddy ! You know nothing about it . ”
44704	44723	44725	44729	an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem ! ahem	2896	“ Nonsense yourself ! I ’ve this minute seen him . He said to me : ‘ Ahem ! Honeychurch,’”—Freddy
44727	44762	44618	44618	Freddy	135	mimic—“‘ahem ! ahem ! I have at last procured really dee - sire - rebel tenants . ’ I said , ‘ ooray , old boy ! ’ and slapped him on the back . ”
44763	44770	44618	44618	Freddy	135	“ Exactly . The Miss Alans ? ”
44771	44779	44618	44618	Freddy	135	“ Rather not . More like Anderson . ”
44780	44795	44796	44797	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Oh , good gracious , there is n’t going to be another muddle ! ”
44800	44837	44796	44797	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Do you notice , Lucy , I ’m always right ? I said do n’t interfere with Cissie Villa . I ’m always right . I ’m quite uneasy at being always right so often . ”
44838	44865	44618	44618	Freddy	135	“ It ’s only another muddle of Freddy ’s . Freddy does n’t even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead . ”
44866	44879	44796	44797	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Yes , I do . I ’ve got it . Emerson . ”
44880	44884	44618	44618	Freddy	135	“ What name ? ”
44885	44896	44796	44797	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Emerson . I ’ll bet you anything you like . ”
44897	44905	44907	44907	Lucy	129	“ What a weathercock Sir Harry is , ”
44910	44922	44907	44907	Lucy	129	“ I wish I had never bothered over it at all . ”
44984	44997	44980	44980	her	134	“ Emerson , Freddy ? Do you know what Emersons they are ? ”
44998	45009	45011	45011	Freddy	135	“ I do n’t know whether they ’re any Emersons , ”
45052	45066	45011	45011	Freddy	135	“ I trust they are the right sort of person . All right , Lucy”—she
45070	45106	45119	45119	She	129	again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother ’s a snob . But there is a right sort and a wrong sort , and it ’s affectation to pretend there is n’t . ”
45107	45115	45116	45116	Lucy	129	“ Emerson ’s a common enough name , ”
45161	45195	45255	45256	his mother	1129	“ I was merely going to remark , Freddy , that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher , a most trying man . Pray , does that satisfy you ? ”
45196	45201	45202	45202	he	1394	“ Oh , yes , ”
45205	45221	45202	45202	he	1394	“ And you will be satisfied , too , for they ’re friends of Cecil ; so”—elaborate
45222	45237	45255	45256	his mother	1129	irony—“you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety . ”
45238	45241	45243	45243	Lucy	129	“ Cecil ? ”
45245	45253	45255	45256	his mother	1129	“ Do n’t be rude , dear , ”
45259	45277	45255	45256	his mother	1129	“ Lucy , do n’t screech . It ’s a new bad habit you ’re getting into . ”
45278	45283	45255	45256	his mother	1129	“ But has Cecil — ”
45284	45290	45291	45291	he	1394	“ Friends of Cecil ’s , ”
45294	45317	45291	45291	he	1394	“ ‘ and so really dee - sire - rebel . Ahem ! Honeychurch , I have just telegraphed to them . ’ ”
45367	45369	45371	45371	she	129	“ screech ”
45423	45442	45420	45420	she	129	“ But Cecil ’s Emersons — they ca n’t possibly be the same ones — there is that — ”
45475	45539	45540	45540	He	380	“ The Emersons who were at Florence , do you mean ? No , I do n’t suppose it will prove to be them . It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr. Vyse ’s . Oh , Mrs. Honeychurch , the oddest people ! The queerest people ! For our part we liked them , did n’t we ? ”
45545	45658	45540	45540	He	380	“ There was a great scene over some violets . They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa . Poor little ladies ! So shocked and so pleased . It used to be one of Miss Catharine ’s great stories . ‘ My dear sister loves flowers , ’ it began . They found the whole room a mass of blue — vases and jugs — and the story ends with ‘ So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful . ’ It is all very difficult . Yes , I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets . ”
45659	45667	45669	45669	Freddy	135	“ Fiasco ’s done you this time , ”
45700	45761	45688	45689	Mr. Beebe	133	“ These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son — the son a goodly , if not a good young man ; not a fool , I fancy , but very immature — pessimism , et cetera . Our special joy was the father — such a sentimental darling , and people declared he had murdered his wife . ”
45797	45802	45804	45805	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Murdered his wife ? ”
45807	45869	45804	45805	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Lucy , do n’t desert us — go on playing bumble - puppy . Really , the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place . That ’s the second murderer I ’ve heard of as being there . Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop ? By - the - by , we really must ask Charlotte here some time . ”
45958	45965	45966	45966	he	881	“ Oh , do n’t go ! ”
45978	45983	45984	45984	she	129	“ I must go , ”
45988	46002	45984	45984	she	129	“ Do n’t be silly . You always overdo it when you play . ”
46012	46015	46007	46008	her mother	493	“ Harris ! ”
46129	46132	46120	46120	Cecil	256	“ Cecil ! ”
46133	46136	46137	46137	he	256	“ Hullo ! ”
46156	46249	46150	46150	He	256	“ I was hoping you ’d come . I heard you all bear - gardening , but there ’s better fun up here . I , even I , have won a great victory for the Comic Muse . George Meredith ’s right — the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same ; and I , even I , have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa . Do n’t be angry ! Do n’t be angry ! You ’ll forgive me when you hear it all . ”
46269	46274	46275	46275	she	1412	“ I have heard , ”
46278	46333	46275	46275	she	1412	“ Freddy has told us . Naughty Cecil ! I suppose I must forgive you . Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing ! Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome , and I ’d rather have nice friends of yours . But you ought n’t to tease one so . ”
46334	46339	46340	46340	he	256	“ Friends of mine ? ”
46343	46358	46340	46340	he	256	“ But , Lucy , the whole joke is to come ! Come here . ”
46367	46394	46360	46360	she	1412	“ Do you know where I met these desirable tenants ? In the National Gallery , when I was up to see my mother last week . ”
46395	46404	46405	46405	she	1412	“ What an odd place to meet people ! ”
46409	46416	46405	46405	she	1412	“ I do n’t quite understand . ”
46417	46458	46275	46275	she	1412	“ In the Umbrian Room . Absolute strangers . They were admiring Luca Signorelli — of course , quite stupidly . However , we got talking , and they refreshed me not a little . They had been to Italy . ”
46459	46464	46405	46405	she	1412	“ But , Cecil — ”
46468	46543	46275	46275	she	1412	“ In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage — the father to live there , the son to run down for week - ends . I thought , ‘ What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry ! ’ and I took their address and a London reference , found they were n’t actual blackguards — it was great sport — and wrote to him , making out — ”
46544	46561	46275	46275	she	1412	“ Cecil ! No , it ’s not fair . I ’ve probably met them before — ”
46567	46648	46275	46275	she	1412	“ Perfectly fair . Anything is fair that punishes a snob . That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good . Sir Harry is too disgusting with his ‘ decayed gentlewomen . ’ I meant to read him a lesson some time . No , Lucy , the classes ought to mix , and before long you ’ll agree with me . There ought to be intermarriage — all sorts of things . I believe in democracy — ”
46649	46656	46657	46657	she	1414	“ No , you do n’t , ”

46706	46772	46695	46695	Her	1414	“ It is n’t fair , Cecil . I blame you — I blame you very much indeed . You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans , and make me look ridiculous . You call it scoring off Sir Harry , but do you realize that it is all at my expense ? I consider it most disloyal of you . ”
46777	46780	46781	46781	he	1416	“ Temper ! ”

47466	47664	47460	47460	September	263	“ I have news of you at last ! Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your parts , but was not sure whether a call would be welcome . Puncturing her tire near Summer Street , and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard , she saw to her astonishment , a door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out . He said his father had just taken the house . He said he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood ( ? ) . He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea . Dear Lucy , I am much worried , and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother , Freddy , and Mr. Vyse , who will forbid him to enter the house , etc . That was a great misfortune , and I dare say you have told them already . Mr. Vyse is so sensitive . I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome . I am very sorry about it all , and should not feel easy unless I warned you .
47665	47669	47680	47680	Lucy	129	“ Believe me , “
47676	47679	47680	47680	Lucy	129	“ CHARLOTTE . ”

47695	47698	47680	47680	Lucy	129	“ DEAR CHARLOTTE ,
47699	47910	47680	47680	Lucy	129	“ Many thanks for your warning . When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the mountain , you made me promise not to tell mother , because you said she would blame you for not being always with me . I have kept that promise , and can not possibly tell her now . I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence , and that they are respectable people — which I do think — and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself . She should have tried at the Rectory . I can not begin making a fuss at this stage . You must see that it would be too absurd . If the Emersons heard I had complained of them , they would think themselves of importance , which is exactly what they are not . I like the old father , and look forward to seeing him again . As for the son , I am sorry for him when we meet , rather than for myself . They are known to Cecil , who is very well and spoke of you the other day . We expect to be married in January .
47911	47953	47959	47961	L. M. HONEYCHURCH	267	“ Miss Lavish can not have told you much about me , for I am not at Windy Corner at all , but here . Please do not put ‘ Private ’ outside your envelope again . No one opens my letters .
47954	47958	47680	47680	Lucy	129	“ Yours affectionately , “

48580	48587	48548	48548	she	261	“ Her music always was wonderful . ”
48588	48627	48548	48548	she	261	“ Yes , but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint , most excellent Honeychurches , but you know what I mean . She is not always quoting servants , or asking one how the pudding is made . ”
48628	48634	48548	48548	she	261	“ Italy has done it . ”
48635	48638	48639	48639	she	261	“ Perhaps , ”
48652	48674	48639	48639	she	261	“ It is just possible . Cecil , mind you marry her next January . She is one of us already . ”
48675	48680	48681	48681	he	1468	“ But her music ! ”
48684	48772	48681	48681	he	1468	“ The style of her ! How she kept to Schumann when , like an idiot , I wanted Beethoven . Schumann was right for this evening . Schumann was the thing . Do you know , mother , I shall have our children educated just like Lucy . Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness , send them to Italy for subtlety , and then — not till then — let them come to London . I do n’t believe in these London educations — ”
48788	48797	48773	48773	He	1469	“ At all events , not for women . ”
48798	48805	48807	48808	Mrs. Vyse	261	“ Make her one of us , ”
48867	48881	48854	48854	She	261	“ I am so sorry , Mrs. Vyse — it is these dreams . ”
48882	48886	48854	48854	She	261	“ Bad dreams ? ”
48887	48891	48854	48854	She	261	“ Just dreams . ”

49159	49162	49163	49163	he	133	“ Hullo ! ”
49185	49188	49180	49182	A grave voice	1480	“ Hullo ! ”
49189	49198	49180	49182	A grave voice	1480	“ I ’ve brought someone to see you . ”
49199	49208	49180	49182	A grave voice	1480	“ I ’ll be down in a minute . ”
49247	49254	49255	49255	Freddy	135	“ Are these people great readers ? ”
49258	49264	49255	49255	Freddy	135	“ Are they that sort ? ”
49265	49343	49180	49182	A grave voice	1480	“ I fancy they know how to read — a rare accomplishment . What have they got ? Byron . Exactly . A Shropshire Lad . Never heard of it . The Way of All Flesh . Never heard of it . Gibbon . Hullo ! dear George reads German . Um — um — Schopenhauer , Nietzsche , and so we go on . Well , I suppose your generation knows its own business , Honeychurch . ”
49344	49352	49354	49354	Freddy	135	“ Mr. Beebe , look at that , ”

49411	49418	49369	49370	an amateur	1485	“ How very odd of him ! ”
49419	49424	49449	49450	the clergyman	380	“ Surely you agree ? ”
49445	49448	49449	49450	the clergyman	380	“ Pictures ! ”
49458	49472	49449	49450	the clergyman	380	“ Giotto — they got that at Florence , I ’ll be bound . ”
49473	49481	49449	49450	the clergyman	380	“ The same as Lucy ’s got . ”
49482	49497	49449	49450	the clergyman	380	“ Oh , by - the - by , did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London ? ”
49498	49504	49449	49450	the clergyman	380	“ She came back yesterday . ”
49505	49514	49449	49450	the clergyman	380	“ I suppose she had a good time ? ”
49515	49520	49522	49522	Freddy	135	“ Yes , very , ”
49529	49538	49522	49522	Freddy	135	“ She and Cecil are thicker than ever . ”
49539	49545	49449	49450	the clergyman	380	“ That ’s good hearing . ”
49546	49559	49522	49522	Freddy	135	“ I wish I was n’t such a fool , Mr. Beebe . ”
49566	49597	49449	49450	the clergyman	380	“ Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am , but it ’ll be very different now , mother thinks . She will read all kinds of books . ”
49598	49603	49449	49450	the clergyman	380	“ So will you . ”
49604	49649	49449	49450	the clergyman	380	“ Only medical books . Not books that you can talk about afterwards . Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian , and he says her playing is wonderful . There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed . Cecil says — ”
49650	49670	49449	49450	the clergyman	380	“ What on earth are those people doing upstairs ? Emerson — we think we ’ll come another time . ”
49685	49695	49671	49671	George	126	“ Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch , a neighbour . ”
49735	49746	49730	49730	he	126	“ How d’ye do ? Come and have a bathe . ”
49747	49753	49755	49755	George	126	“ Oh , all right , ”
49765	49782	49783	49783	he	133	“ ‘ How d’ye do ? how d’ye do ? Come and have a bathe , ’ ”
49786	49853	49783	49783	he	133	“ That ’s the best conversational opening I ’ve ever heard . But I ’m afraid it will only act between men . Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘ How do you do ? Come and have a bathe ’ ? And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal . ”
49854	49863	49865	49874	Mr. Emerson , who had been slowly descending the stairs	1494	“ I tell you that they shall be , ”
49876	49897	49865	49874	Mr. Emerson , who had been slowly descending the stairs	1494	“ Good afternoon , Mr. Beebe . I tell you they shall be comrades , and George thinks the same . ”

49927	49953	49921	49922	Mr. Emerson	171	“ which you place in the past , is really yet to come . We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies . ”
49964	49999	49865	49874	Mr. Emerson , who had been slowly descending the stairs	1494	“ In this — not in other things — we men are ahead . We despise the body less than women do . But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden . ”
50000	50009	50011	50011	Freddy	135	“ I say , what about this bathe ? ”
50024	50074	49865	49874	Mr. Emerson , who had been slowly descending the stairs	1494	“ I believed in a return to Nature once . But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her ? To - day , I believe that we must discover Nature . After many conquests we shall attain simplicity . It is our heritage . ”
50075	50090	49865	49874	Mr. Emerson , who had been slowly descending the stairs	1494	“ Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch , whose sister you will remember at Florence . ”
50091	50226	49865	49874	Mr. Emerson , who had been slowly descending the stairs	1494	“ How do you do ? Very glad to see you , and that you are taking George for a bathe . Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry . Marriage is a duty . I am sure that she will be happy , for we know Mr. Vyse , too . He has been most kind . He met us by chance in the National Gallery , and arranged everything about this delightful house . Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway . I have met so few Liberal landowners , and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude . Ah , this wind ! You do well to bathe . Yours is a glorious country , Honeychurch ! ”
50227	50232	50234	50234	Freddy	135	“ Not a bit ! ”
50236	50266	50234	50234	Freddy	135	“ I must — that is to say , I have to — have the pleasure of calling on you later on , my mother says , I hope . ”
50267	50301	49865	49874	Mr. Emerson , who had been slowly descending the stairs	1494	“ Call , my lad ? Who taught us that drawing - room twaddle ? Call on your grandmother ! Listen to the wind among the pines ! Yours is a glorious country . ”
50309	50376	49865	49874	Mr. Emerson , who had been slowly descending the stairs	1494	“ Mr. Emerson , he will call , I shall call ; you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed . I trust that you have realized about the ten days ’ interval . It does not count that I helped you with the stair - eyes yesterday . It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon . ”
50377	50432	49865	49874	Mr. Emerson , who had been slowly descending the stairs	1494	“ Yes , go and bathe , George . Why do you dawdle talking ? Bring them back to tea . Bring back some milk , cakes , honey . The change will do you good . George has been working very hard at his office . I ca n’t believe he ’s well . ”
50453	50461	50462	50462	Freddy	135	“ Do you really want this bathe ? ”
50466	50488	50462	50462	Freddy	135	“ It is only a pond , do n’t you know . I dare say you are used to something better . ”
50489	50500	50435	50435	his	126	“ Yes — I have said ‘ Yes ’ already . ”
50637	50663	50604	50604	He	133	“ And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse ! Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here ? ”
50664	50674	50604	50604	He	133	“ I did not . Miss Lavish told me . ”
50675	50695	50604	50604	He	133	“ When I was a young man , I always meant to write a ‘ History of Coincidence . ’ ”
50699	50736	50604	50604	He	133	“ Though , as a matter of fact , coincidences are much rarer than we suppose . For example , it is n’t purely coincidentally that you are here now , when one comes to reflect . ”
50746	50790	50741	50741	George	126	“ It is . I have reflected . It is Fate . Everything is Fate . We are flung together by Fate , drawn apart by Fate — flung together , drawn apart . The twelve winds blow us — we settle nothing — ”
50791	50799	50801	50802	the clergyman	380	“ You have not reflected at all , ”
50804	50859	50801	50802	the clergyman	380	“ Let me give you a useful tip , Emerson : attribute nothing to Fate . Do n’t say , ‘ I did n’t do this , ’ for you did it , ten to one . Now I ’ll cross - question you . Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself ? ”
50860	50863	50741	50741	George	126	“ Italy . ”
50864	50881	50801	50802	the clergyman	380	“ And where did you meet Mr. Vyse , who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch ? ”
50882	50886	50741	50741	George	126	“ National Gallery . ”
50887	50932	50801	50802	the clergyman	380	“ Looking at Italian art . There you are , and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate . You naturally seek out things Italian , and so do we and our friends . This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it . ”
50933	50942	50944	50944	George	126	“ It is Fate that I am here , ”
50946	50960	50944	50944	George	126	“ But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy . ”
50990	51010	50974	50974	he	133	“ And so for this and for other reasons my ‘ History of Coincidence ’ is still to write . ”
51023	51034	51020	51020	he	133	“ We are all so glad that you have come . ”
51037	51042	51044	51044	Freddy	135	“ Here we are ! ”
51046	51051	51053	51054	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Oh , good ! ”
51060	51073	51074	51074	he	133	“ In there ’s the pond . I wish it was bigger , ”
51153	51163	51165	51166	Mr. Beebe	133	“ It ’s distinctly successful , as ponds go , ”
51168	51177	51165	51166	Mr. Beebe	133	“ No apologies are necessary for the pond . ”
51193	51221	51293	51294	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Are n’t those masses of willow - herb splendid ? I love willow - herb in seed . What ’s the name of this aromatic plant ? ”
51231	51274	51293	51294	Mr. Beebe	133	“ These abrupt changes of vegetation — this little spongeous tract of water plants , and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle — heather , bracken , hurts , pines . Very charming , very charming . ”
51275	51284	51286	51286	Freddy	135	“ Mr. Beebe , are n’t you bathing ? ”
51300	51305	51307	51307	Freddy	135	“ Water ’s wonderful ! ”
51312	51317	51319	51319	George	126	“ Water ’s water , ”
51390	51397	51399	51399	Freddy	135	“ Apooshoo , apooshoo , apooshoo , ”
51418	51424	51426	51427	the other	2602	“ Is it worth it ? ”
51454	51476	51441	51441	he	2602	“ Hee - poof — I’ve swallowed a pollywog , Mr. Beebe , water ’s wonderful , water ’s simply ripping . ”
51477	51484	51486	51486	George	126	“ Water ’s not so bad , ”
51499	51509	51441	51441	he	2602	“ Water ’s wonderful . Mr. Beebe , do . ”
51510	51515	51441	51441	he	2602	“ Apooshoo , kouf . ”
51606	51613	51617	51617	his	133	“ I may as well wash too ”
51811	51819	51821	51821	Freddy	135	“ Race you round it , then , ”
51908	51933	51996	51997	Mr. Beebe	133	“ No . We are what matters . Without us shall no enterprise begin . To us shall all flesh turn in the end . ”
51934	51941	51943	51943	Freddy	135	“ A try ! A try ! ”
51960	51964	51965	51965	George	126	“ Socker rules , ”
51976	51979	51965	51965	George	126	“ Goal ! ”
51980	51983	51965	51965	George	126	“ Goal ! ”
51984	51987	51965	51965	George	126	“ Pass ! ”
51988	51994	51996	51997	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Take care my watch ! ”
52005	52027	51965	51965	George	126	“ Take care my hat ! No , that ’s enough , Freddy . Dress now . No , I say ! ”
52064	52069	52071	52072	Mr. Beebe	133	“ That ’ll do ! ”
52100	52113	52086	52086	his	133	“ Hi ! Steady on ! I see people coming you fellows ! ”
52124	52131	52146	52147	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Hi ! hi ! Ladies ! ”
52214	52218	52220	52221	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Gracious alive ! ”
52223	52248	52220	52221	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Whoever were those unfortunate people ? Oh , dears , look away ! And poor Mr. Beebe , too ! Whatever has happened ? ”
52249	52255	52257	52257	Cecil	256	“ Come this way immediately , ”
52297	52321	52285	52285	He	256	“ Oh , poor Mr. Beebe ! Was that his waistcoat we left in the path ? Cecil , Mr. Beebe ’s waistcoat — ”
52340	52343	52332	52332	Lucy	129	“ minded . ”
52344	52355	52328	52328	Cecil	256	“ I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond . ”
52356	52368	52401	52404	a voice close ahead	1536	“ This way , please , Mrs. Honeychurch , this way . ”
52390	52399	52401	52404	a voice close ahead	1536	“ Well , I ca n’t help it , ”
52423	52434	52407	52407	Freddy	135	“ I ca n’t be trodden on , can I ? ”
52435	52467	52401	52404	a voice close ahead	1536	“ Good gracious me , dear ; so it ’s you ! What miserable management ! Why not have a comfortable bath at home , with hot and cold laid on ? ”
52468	52492	52407	52407	Freddy	135	“ Look here , mother , a fellow must wash , and a fellow ’s got to dry , and if another fellow — ”
52493	52517	52518	52518	They	1537	“ Dear , no doubt you ’re right as usual , but you are in no position to argue . Come , Lucy . ”
52521	52539	52518	52518	They	1537	“ Oh , look — don’t look ! Oh , poor Mr. Beebe ! How unfortunate again — ”
52581	52590	52592	52592	he	126	“ And me , I ’ve swallowed one , ”
52597	52625	52592	52592	he	126	“ I ’ve swallowed a pollywog . It wriggleth in my tummy . I shall die — Emerson you beast , you ’ve got on my bags . ”
52626	52631	52633	52634	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Hush , dears , ”
52644	52664	52633	52634	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first . All these colds come of not drying thoroughly . ”
52665	52672	52674	52674	Lucy	129	“ Mother , do come away , ”
52676	52686	52674	52674	Lucy	129	“ Oh for goodness ’ sake , do come . ”
52687	52690	52692	52692	George	126	“ Hullo ! ”
52724	52732	52721	52721	he	126	“ Hullo , Miss Honeychurch ! Hullo ! ”
52733	52749	52721	52721	he	126	“ Bow , Lucy ; better bow . Whoever is it ? I shall bow . ”
53012	53017	53018	53018	she	129	“ I will bow , ”
53022	53039	53018	53018	she	129	“ I will not shake hands with him . That will be just the proper thing . ”
53154	53156	53142	53142	he	256	“ Yes ”
53158	53160	53142	53142	he	256	“ No ”
53244	53247	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ Lucy , ”
53257	53265	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ is anything the matter with Cecil ? ”
53283	53299	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ No , I do n’t think so , mother ; Cecil ’s all right . ”
53300	53306	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ Perhaps he ’s tired . ”
53317	53319	53322	53322	her	134	“ Because otherwise”—she
53328	53337	53249	53250	her mother	493	displeasure—“because otherwise I can not account for him . ”
53338	53353	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome , if you mean that . ”
53354	53396	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ Cecil has told you to think so . You were devoted to her as a little girl , and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever . No — it is just the same thing everywhere . ”
53397	53409	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ Let me just put your bonnet away , may I ? ”
53410	53423	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ Surely he could answer her civilly for one half - hour ? ”
53424	53434	53436	53436	Lucy	129	“ Cecil has a very high standard for people , ”
53442	53460	53436	53436	Lucy	129	“ It ’s part of his ideals — it is really that that makes him sometimes seem — ”
53461	53485	53487	53488	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Oh , rubbish ! If high ideals make a young man rude , the sooner he gets rid of them the better , ”
53495	53510	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ Now , mother ! I ’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself ! ”
53511	53542	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ Not in that way . At times I could wring her neck . But not in that way . No . It is the same with Cecil all over . ”
53543	53568	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ By - the - by — I never told you . I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London . ”
53585	53657	53436	53436	Lucy	129	“ Since Cecil came back from London , nothing appears to please him . Whenever I speak he winces;—I see him , Lucy ; it is useless to contradict me . No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical , but I can not help the drawing - room furniture ; your father bought it and we must put up with it , will Cecil kindly remember . ”
53658	53710	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ I — I see what you mean , and certainly Cecil ought n’t to . But he does not mean to be uncivil — he once explained — it is the things that upset him — he is easily upset by ugly things — he is not uncivil to people . ”
53711	53723	53436	53436	Lucy	129	“ Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings ? ”
53724	53741	53249	53250	her mother	493	“ You ca n’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do . ”
53742	53763	53436	53436	Lucy	129	“ Then why did n’t he leave the room ? Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone ’s pleasure ? ”
53764	53773	53775	53775	Lucy	129	“ We must n’t be unjust to people , ”
53946	53958	53896	53896	she	134	“ Go and dress , dear ; you ’ll be late . ”
53959	53965	53896	53896	she	134	“ All right , mother — ”
53966	53979	53896	53896	she	134	“ Do n’t say ‘ All right ’ and stop . Go . ”
54045	54060	54040	54040	she	129	“ Oh , dear , what shall I do , what shall I do ? ”
54130	54139	54115	54115	Freddy	135	“ I say , those are topping people . ”
54140	54197	54115	54115	Freddy	135	“ My dear baby , how tiresome you ’ve been ! You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred Lake ; it ’s much too public . It was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else . Do be more careful . You forget the place is growing half suburban . ”
54198	54210	54115	54115	Freddy	135	“ I say , is anything on to - morrow week ? ”
54211	54218	54115	54115	Freddy	135	“ Not that I know of . ”
54219	54232	54115	54115	Freddy	135	“ Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis . ”
54233	54254	54115	54115	Freddy	135	“ Oh , I would n’t do that , Freddy , I would n’t do that with all this muddle . ”
54255	54279	54115	54115	Freddy	135	“ What ’s wrong with the court ? They wo n’t mind a bump or two , and I ’ve ordered new balls . ”
54280	54293	54294	54294	He	1569	“ I meant it ’s better not . I really mean it . ”
54356	54385	54348	54349	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Lucy , what a noise you ’re making ! I have something to say to you . Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte ? ”
54391	54405	54348	54349	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Yes . I really ca n’t stop . I must dress too . ”
54406	54411	54348	54349	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ How ’s Charlotte ? ”
54412	54416	54348	54349	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ All right . ”
54417	54420	54348	54349	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Lucy ! ”
54426	54449	54348	54349	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ You ’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one ’s sentences . Did Charlotte mention her boiler ? ”
54450	54454	54348	54349	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Her what ? ”
54455	54487	54348	54349	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Do n’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October , and her bath cistern cleaned out , and all kinds of terrible to - doings ? ”
54488	54498	54500	54500	Lucy	129	“ I ca n’t remember all Charlotte ’s worries , ”
54503	54521	54500	54500	Lucy	129	“ I shall have enough of my own , now that you are not pleased with Cecil . ”
54536	54554	54533	54533	She	134	“ Come here , old lady — thank you for putting away my bonnet — kiss me . ”
54685	54693	54682	54682	Freddy	135	“ Lucy , what ’s Emerson like ? ”
54694	54701	54703	54703	Lucy	129	“ I saw him in Florence , ”
54714	54728	54682	54682	Freddy	135	“ Is he the clever sort , or is he a decent chap ? ”
54729	54741	54682	54682	Freddy	135	“ Ask Cecil ; it is Cecil who brought him here . ”
54742	54752	54754	54754	Cecil	256	“ He is the clever sort , like myself , ”
54762	54773	54775	54776	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ How well did you know them at the Bertolini ? ”
54778	54796	54682	54682	Freddy	135	“ Oh , very slightly . I mean , Charlotte knew them even less than I did . ”
54797	54815	54682	54682	Freddy	135	“ Oh , that reminds me — you never told me what Charlotte said in her letter . ”
54816	54822	54824	54824	Lucy	129	“ One thing and another , ”
54838	54871	54824	54824	Lucy	129	“ Among other things , that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street , wondered if she ’d come up and see us , and mercifully did n’t . ”
54872	54884	54918	54918	She	134	“ Lucy , I do call the way you talk unkind . ”
54885	54891	54893	54893	Lucy	129	“ She was a novelist , ”
54948	54961	54964	54964	she	134	“ If books must be written , let them be written by men ”
54978	54989	54964	54964	she	134	“ This year , next year , now , never , ”
55121	55140	55110	55111	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I have been thinking , Lucy , of that letter of Charlotte ’s . How is she ? ”
55141	55148	55110	55111	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I tore the thing up . ”
55149	55165	55110	55111	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Did n’t she say how she was ? How does she sound ? Cheerful ? ”
55166	55183	55110	55111	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Oh , yes I suppose so — no — not very cheerful , I suppose . ”
55184	55220	55110	55111	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Then , depend upon it , it is the boiler . I know myself how water preys upon one ’s mind . I would rather anything else — even a misfortune with the meat . ”
55229	55234	55236	55236	Freddy	135	“ So would I , ”
55255	55262	55263	55263	she	1129	“ And I have been thinking , ”
55268	55303	55263	55263	she	1129	“ surely we could squeeze Charlotte in here next week , and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish . I have not seen poor Charlotte for so long . ”
55328	55333	55334	55334	she	1129	“ Mother , no ! ”
55337	55398	55334	55334	she	1129	“ It ’s impossible . We ca n’t have Charlotte on the top of the other things ; we ’re squeezed to death as it is . Freddy ’s got a friend coming Tuesday , there ’s Cecil , and you ’ve promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare . It simply ca n’t be done . ”
55399	55405	55334	55334	she	1129	“ Nonsense ! It can . ”
55406	55417	55334	55334	she	1129	“ If Minnie sleeps in the bath . Not otherwise . ”
55418	55425	55334	55334	she	1129	“ Minnie can sleep with you . ”
55426	55433	55334	55334	she	1129	“ I wo n’t have her . ”
55434	55452	55334	55334	she	1129	“ Then , if you ’re so selfish , Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy . ”
55453	55463	55465	55465	Cecil	256	“ Miss Bartlett , Miss Bartlett , Miss Bartlett , ”
55475	55480	55482	55482	Lucy	129	“ It ’s impossible , ”
55484	55509	55482	55482	Lucy	129	“ I do n’t want to make difficulties , but it really is n’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so . ”
55512	55525	55334	55334	she	1129	“ The truth is , dear , you do n’t like Charlotte . ”
55526	55589	55599	55600	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ No , I do n’t . And no more does Cecil . She gets on our nerves . You have n’t seen her lately , and do n’t realize how tiresome she can be , though so good . So please , mother , do n’t worry us this last summer ; but spoil us by not asking her to come . ”
55590	55595	55597	55597	Cecil	256	“ Hear , hear ! ”
55620	55692	55599	55600	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ This is n’t very kind of you two . You have each other and all these woods to walk in , so full of beautiful things ; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers . You are young , dears , and however clever young people are , and however many books they read , they will never guess what it feels like to grow old . ”
55698	55717	55720	55720	Freddy	135	“ I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike , ”
55722	55752	55720	55720	Freddy	135	“ She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool , and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right . ”
55753	55781	55783	55783	Lucy	129	“ I know , dear . She is kind to everyone , and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return . ”
55838	55861	55832	55832	She	129	“ I ca n’t help it , mother . I do n’t like Charlotte . I admit it ’s horrid of me . ”
55862	55874	55832	55832	She	129	“ From your own account , you told her as much . ”
55875	55888	55832	55832	She	129	“ Well , she would leave Florence so stupidly . She flurried — ”
55959	55974	55976	55976	Cecil	256	“ I suppose Miss Bartlett must come , since she boils eggs so well , ”
55994	56005	56007	56007	Freddy	135	“ I did n’t mean the egg was well boiled , ”
56009	56044	56007	56007	Freddy	135	“ because in point of fact she forgot to take it off , and as a matter of fact I do n’t care for eggs . I only meant how jolly kind she seemed . ”
56069	56080	56081	56081	he	135	“ May me and Lucy get down from our chairs ? ”
56089	56097	56081	56081	he	135	“ We do n’t want no dessert . ”
56312	56327	56329	56329	Cecil	256	“ things that came out of nothing and meant she did n’t know what . ”
56363	56369	56358	56359	the reader	1602	“ She loves young Emerson . ”
56396	56398	56420	56421	the reader	1602	“ nerves ”
56499	56504	56506	56507	Mr. Beebe	133	“ A nice fellow , ”
56509	56530	56506	56507	Mr. Beebe	133	“ He will work off his crudities in time . I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully . ”
56534	56545	56531	56531	Lucy	129	“ He seems in better spirits . He laughs more . ”
56546	56549	56551	56552	the clergyman	380	“ Yes , ”
56554	56560	56551	56552	the clergyman	380	“ He is waking up . ”
56696	56703	56705	56706	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I shall never forgive myself , ”
56728	56757	56705	56706	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I have upset everything . Bursting in on young people ! But I insist on paying for my cab up . Grant that , at any rate . ”
56758	56767	56769	56769	Lucy	129	“ Our visitors never do such dreadful things , ”
56791	56812	56772	56773	her brother	881	“ Just what I ’ve been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of , Lucy , for the last half hour . ”
56813	56823	56825	56826	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor , ”
56835	56857	56772	56773	her brother	881	“ All right , if you ’d really rather . Five shillings , and I gave a bob to the driver . ”
56900	56911	56891	56892	Miss Bartlett	128	“ But who am I to give the sovereign to ? ”
56912	56923	56925	56925	Lucy	129	“ Let ’s leave it all till mother comes back , ”
56927	56965	56925	56925	Lucy	129	“ No , dear ; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me . We all have our little foibles , and mine is the prompt settling of accounts . ”
57036	57068	57142	57143	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Please — please — I know I am a sad spoil - sport , but it would make me wretched . I should practically be robbing the one who lost . ”
57069	57076	57078	57078	Cecil	256	“ Freddy owes me fifteen shillings , ”
57080	57095	57078	57078	Cecil	256	“ So it will work out right if you give the pound to me . ”
57096	57100	57102	57103	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Fifteen shillings , ”
57106	57114	57102	57103	Miss Bartlett	128	“ How is that , Mr. Vyse ? ”
57115	57141	57078	57078	Cecil	256	“ Because , do n’t you see , Freddy paid your cab . Give me the pound , and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling . ”
57212	57220	57222	57223	Minnie Beebe	248	“ But I do n’t see that ! ”
57232	57246	57222	57223	Minnie Beebe	248	“ I do n’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the quid . ”
57247	57257	57258	57258	they	1625	“ Because of the fifteen shillings and the five , ”
57262	57275	57258	57258	they	1625	“ Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound , you see . ”
57276	57283	57222	57223	Minnie Beebe	248	“ But I do n’t see — ”
57292	57363	57222	57223	Minnie Beebe	248	“ No , thank you . I ’m done . I do n’t see why — Freddy , do n’t poke me . Miss Honeychurch , your brother ’s hurting me . Ow ! What about Mr. Floyd ’s ten shillings ? Ow ! No , I do n’t see and I never shall see why Miss What’s - her - name should n’t pay that bob for the driver . ”
57364	57371	57373	57374	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I had forgotten the driver , ”
57378	57404	57373	57374	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Thank you , dear , for reminding me . A shilling was it ? Can any one give me change for half a crown ? ”
57405	57411	57413	57415	the young hostess	1626	“ I ’ll get it , ”
57421	57457	57373	57374	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Cecil , give me that sovereign . No , give me up that sovereign . I ’ll get Euphemia to change it , and we ’ll start the whole thing again from the beginning . ”
57458	57469	57471	57472	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Lucy — Lucy — what a nuisance I am ! ”
57504	57513	57494	57495	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Have you told him about him yet ? ”
57514	57521	57523	57523	Lucy	129	“ No , I have n’t , ”
57541	57553	57530	57530	her	129	“ Let me see — a sovereign ’s worth of silver . ”
57604	57616	57617	57617	she	128	“ No , I have n’t told Cecil or any one , ”
57624	57659	57617	57617	she	128	“ I promised you I should n’t . Here is your money — all shillings , except two half - crowns . Would you count it ? You can settle your debt nicely now . ”
57683	57687	57688	57688	she	128	“ How dreadful ! ”
57691	57711	57688	57688	she	128	“ how more than dreadful , if Mr. Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source . ”
57712	57719	57721	57722	the girl	381	“ Oh , no , Charlotte , ”
57728	57742	57721	57722	the girl	381	“ George Emerson is all right , and what other source is there ? ”
57747	57773	57743	57744	Miss Bartlett	128	“ For instance , the driver . I saw him looking through the bushes at you , remember he had a violet between his teeth . ”
57779	57808	57774	57774	Lucy	129	“ We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we are n’t careful . How could a Florentine cab - driver ever get hold of Cecil ? ”
57809	57817	57721	57722	the girl	381	“ We must think of every possibility . ”
57818	57826	57774	57774	Lucy	129	“ Oh , it ’s all right . ”
57827	57844	57721	57722	the girl	381	“ Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows . In fact , he is certain to know . ”
57845	57883	57774	57774	Lucy	129	“ I do n’t care if he does . I was grateful to you for your letter , but even if the news does get round , I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it . ”
57884	57889	57721	57722	the girl	381	“ To contradict it ? ”
57890	57898	57774	57774	Lucy	129	“ No , to laugh at it . ”
57918	57946	57721	57722	the girl	381	“ Very well , dear , you know best . Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young . Ladies are certainly different . ”
57947	57952	57953	57953	She	129	“ Now , Charlotte ! ”
57959	57999	57953	57953	She	129	“ You kind , anxious thing . What would you have me do ? First you say ‘ Do n’t tell ’ ; and then you say , ‘ Tell ’ . Which is it to be ? Quick ! ”
58003	58053	58000	58001	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I am no match for you in conversation , dearest . I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence , and you so well able to look after yourself , and so much cleverer in all ways than I am . You will never forgive me . ”
58054	58073	57721	57722	the girl	381	“ Shall we go out , then . They will smash all the china if we do n’t . ”
58092	58117	58000	58001	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Dear , one moment — we may not have this chance for a chat again . Have you seen the young one yet ? ”
58118	58124	58000	58001	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Yes , I have . ”
58125	58129	58000	58001	Miss Bartlett	128	“ What happened ? ”
58130	58137	58000	58001	Miss Bartlett	128	“ We met at the Rectory . ”
58138	58146	58000	58001	Miss Bartlett	128	“ What line is he taking up ? ”
58147	58204	58000	58001	Miss Bartlett	128	“ No line . He talked about Italy , like any other person . It is really all right . What advantage would he get from being a cad , to put it bluntly ? I do wish I could make you see it my way . He really wo n’t be any nuisance , Charlotte . ”
58205	58220	58000	58001	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Once a cad , always a cad . That is my poor opinion . ”
58224	58251	58252	58252	She	129	“ Cecil said one day — and I thought it so profound — that there are two kinds of cads — the conscious and the subconscious . ”
58302	58311	58313	58314	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Once a cad , always a cad , ”
58316	58496	58497	58497	She	1638	“ What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head . I fell into all those violets , and he was silly and surprised . I do n’t think we ought to blame him very much . It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly . It really does ; it makes an enormous difference , and he lost his head : he does n’t admire me , or any of that nonsense , one straw . Freddy rather likes him , and has asked him up here on Sunday , so you can judge for yourself . He has improved ; he does n’t always look as if he ’s going to burst into tears . He is a clerk in the General Manager ’s office at one of the big railways — not a porter ! and runs down to his father for week - ends . Papa was to do with journalism , but is rheumatic and has retired . There ! Now for the garden . ”
58507	58538	58497	58497	She	1638	“ Suppose we do n’t talk about this silly Italian business any more . We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner , with no worriting . ”
58759	58766	58768	58768	I	0	“ The men say they wo n’t go”—“Well
58772	58775	58777	58777	she	1652	them”—Minnie says , “
58778	58782	58784	58784	Mary	232	go?”—“Tell her , no nonsense”—“Anne
58788	58800	58787	58787	me	0	behind!”—“Dearest Lucia , may I trespass upon you for a pin ? ”
59055	59082	59037	59037	she	129	“ Lucy ! Lucy ! What ’s that book ? Who ’s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil ? ”
59083	59096	59037	59037	she	129	“ It ’s only the library book that Cecil ’s been reading . ”
59097	59113	59037	59037	she	129	“ But pick it up , and do n’t stand idling there like a flamingo . ”
59201	59212	59197	59197	Cecil	256	“ What ! you are n’t forgetting your Italy already ? ”
59248	59263	59223	59223	she	129	“ Lucy — have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself ? ”
59281	59347	59268	59269	her mother	493	“ It ’s a special collection — I forget what for . I do beg , no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies ; see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence . Where is the child ? Minnie ! That book ’s all warped . ( Gracious , how plain you look ! ) Put it under the Atlas to press . Minnie ! ”
59348	59354	59457	59457	she	1668	“ Oh , Mrs. Honeychurch — ”
59360	59371	59268	59269	her mother	493	“ Minnie , do n’t be late . Here comes the horse”—it
59381	59422	59268	59269	her mother	493	“ Where ’s Charlotte ? Run up and hurry her . Why is she so long ? She had nothing to do . She never brings anything but blouses . Poor Charlotte — How I do detest blouses ! Minnie ! ”
59512	59541	59494	59495	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Dear Marian , I am very sorry , but I have no small change — nothing but sovereigns and half crowns . Could any one give me — ”
59542	59570	59494	59495	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Yes , easily . Jump in . Gracious me , how smart you look ! What a lovely frock ! You put us all to shame . ”
59571	59590	59592	59593	Miss Bartlett	128	“ If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now , when should I wear them ? ”
59622	59630	59633	59633	Cecil	256	“ Good - bye ! Be good ! ”
59650	59655	59664	59664	He	256	“ church and so on ”
59801	59805	59807	59808	her mother	493	“ Introduce me , ”
59810	59822	59807	59808	her mother	493	“ Unless the young man considers that he knows me already . ”
59905	59909	59910	59910	he	2750	“ Very much , ”
59935	59970	59932	59932	He	2750	“ We find , though , that the Miss Alans were coming , and that we have turned them out . Women mind such a thing . I am very much upset about it . ”
59971	59980	59982	59983	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ I believe that there was some misunderstanding , ”
59986	60001	60003	60003	George	126	“ Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person , ”
60014	60026	60003	60003	George	126	“ He thought we should be artistic . He is disappointed . ”
60027	60052	60053	60053	He	126	“ And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up . What do you think ? ”
60058	60067	60069	60069	Lucy	129	“ Oh , stop now you have come , ”
60096	60120	60155	60156	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ So George says . He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall . Yet it does seem so unkind . ”
60121	60134	60136	60136	George	126	“ There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world , ”
60150	60153	60155	60156	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Yes ! ”
60158	60177	60155	60156	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ That ’s exactly what I say . Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans ? ”
60178	60197	60198	60198	he	126	“ There is a certain amount of kindness , just as there is a certain amount of light , ”
60204	60273	60198	60198	he	126	“ We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand , and it is no good moving from place to place to save things ; because the shadow always follows . Choose a place where you wo n’t do harm — yes , choose a place where you wo n’t do very much harm , and stand in it for all you are worth , facing the sunshine . ”
60274	60286	60155	60156	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Oh , Mr. Emerson , I see you ’re clever ! ”
60287	60291	60198	60198	he	126	“ Eh — ? ”
60292	60315	60155	60156	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ I see you ’re going to be clever . I hope you did n’t go behaving like that to poor Freddy . ”
60335	60342	60343	60343	he	126	“ No , I did n’t , ”
60346	60376	60343	60343	he	126	“ He behaved that way to me . It is his philosophy . Only he starts life with it ; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first . ”
60377	60417	60316	60316	George	126	“ What do you mean ? No , never mind what you mean . Do n’t explain . He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon . Do you play tennis ? Do you mind tennis on Sunday — ? ”
60418	60435	60343	60343	he	126	“ George mind tennis on Sunday ! George , after his education , distinguish between Sunday — ”
60436	60472	60316	60316	George	126	“ Very well , George does n’t mind tennis on Sunday . No more do I. That ’s settled . Mr. Emerson , if you could come with your son we should be so pleased . ”
60498	60513	60493	60493	She	1691	“ And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans . ”
60514	60518	60520	60520	George	126	“ I know , ”
60582	60591	60593	60594	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ You know our cousin , Miss Bartlett , ”
60597	60607	60593	60594	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ You met her with my daughter in Florence . ”
60608	60613	60615	60617	the old man	360	“ Yes , indeed ! ”
60713	60727	60710	60710	He	126	“ I — I’ll come up to tennis if I can manage it , ”
60819	60826	60840	60840	his	395	“ George , do n’t go , ”
60847	60870	60828	60829	his father	395	“ George has been in such good spirits today , and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon . ”
60887	60890	60891	60891	she	129	“ Yes , ”
60898	60905	60891	60891	she	129	“ I do hope he will . ”
60915	60931	60907	60907	she	129	“ The old man has n’t been told ; I knew it was all right . ”
60999	61010	61011	61011	Her	129	“ He has not told , he has not told . ”
61017	61049	61050	61050	She	129	“ He has not told his father — to whom he tells all things . It was not an exploit . He did not laugh at me when I had gone . ”
61058	61084	61050	61050	She	129	“ He does not love me . No . How terrible if he did ! But he has not told . He will not tell . ”
61092	61113	61085	61085	She	129	“ It is all right . It ’s a secret between us two for ever . Cecil will never hear . ”
61195	61209	61192	61192	she	129	“ The Emersons have been so nice . George Emerson has improved enormously . ”
61210	61216	61218	61218	Cecil	256	“ How are my protégés ? ”
61245	61248	61249	61249	she	129	“ Protégés ! ”
61286	61319	61320	61320	She	129	“ You shall see for yourself how your protégés are . George Emerson is coming up this afternoon . He is a most interesting man to talk to . Only do n’t — ”
61324	61330	61320	61320	She	129	“ Do n’t protect him . ”
61409	61433	61401	61407	a Being who whispered to her soul	1724	“ It will not last , this cheerfulness . In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men . ”
61568	61581	61559	61559	Cecil	256	“ Now play us the other garden — the one in Parsifal . ”
61587	61592	61594	61595	her mother	493	“ Not very dutiful , ”
61623	61631	61632	61632	she	129	“ Oh , I had no idea ! ”
61666	61674	61676	61677	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Our performer has changed her mind , ”
61724	61729	61731	61731	Freddy	135	“ I vote tennis , ”
61739	61745	61748	61748	she	129	“ Yes , so do I. ”
61754	61764	61748	61748	she	129	“ I vote you have a men ’s four . ”
61765	61769	61721	61721	she	129	“ All right . ”
61770	61778	61780	61780	Cecil	256	“ Not for me , thank you , ”
61782	61790	61780	61780	Cecil	256	“ I will not spoil the set . ”
61812	61835	61836	61836	George	126	“ Oh , come along Cecil . I ’m bad , Floyd ’s rotten , and so I dare say ’s Emerson . ”
61840	61846	61836	61836	George	126	“ I am not bad . ”
61856	61864	61866	61866	Cecil	256	“ Then certainly I wo n’t play , ”
61883	61903	61876	61876	she	128	“ I agree with you , Mr. Vyse . You had much better not play . Much better not . ”
61920	61934	61904	61904	Minnie	248	“ I shall miss every ball anyway , so what does it matter ? ”
61946	61955	61957	61958	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Then it will have to be Lucy , ”
61960	61985	61957	61958	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ you must fall back on Lucy . There is no other way out of it . Lucy , go and change your frock . ”
62146	62157	62132	62132	he	126	“ I shall want to live , I tell you . ”
62359	62373	62346	62346	He	256	“ I say , listen to this , Lucy . Three split infinitives . ”
62374	62377	62379	62379	Lucy	129	“ Dreadful ! ”
62435	62443	62430	62432	the other two	1752	“ The scene is laid in Florence . ”
62444	62465	62466	62466	She	129	“ What fun , Cecil ! Read away . Come , Mr. Emerson , sit down after all your energy . ”
62468	62470	62479	62479	she	129	“ forgiven ”
62502	62510	62489	62489	He	256	“ You — and are you tired ? ”
62511	62518	62489	62489	He	256	“ Of course I ’m not ! ”
62519	62526	62489	62489	He	256	“ Do you mind being beaten ? ”
62533	62536	62527	62527	She	129	“ No , ”
62550	62553	62554	62554	She	129	“ Yes . ”
62558	62585	62554	62554	She	129	“ I do n’t see you ’re such a splendid player , though . The light was behind you , and it was in my eyes . ”
62586	62593	62527	62527	She	129	“ I never said I was . ”
62594	62600	62554	62554	She	129	“ Why , you did ! ”
62601	62607	62527	62527	She	129	“ You did n’t attend . ”
62608	62639	62554	62554	She	129	“ You said — oh , do n’t go in for accuracy at this house . We all exaggerate , and we get very angry with people who do n’t . ”
62640	62650	62652	62652	Cecil	256	“ ‘ The scene is laid in Florence , ’ ”
62663	62672	62554	62554	She	129	“ ‘ Sunset . Leonora was speeding — ’ ”
62676	62690	62673	62673	Lucy	129	“ Leonora ? Is Leonora the heroine ? Who ’s the book by ? ”
62691	62741	62554	62554	She	129	“ Joseph Emery Prank . ‘ Sunset . Leonora speeding across the square . Pray the saints she might not arrive too late . Sunset — the sunset of Italy . Under Orcagna ’s Loggia — the Loggia de ’ Lanzi , as we sometimes call it now — ’ ”
62747	62779	62742	62742	Lucy	129	“ ‘ Joseph Emery Prank ’ indeed ! Why it ’s Miss Lavish ! It ’s Miss Lavish ’s novel , and she ’s publishing it under somebody else ’s name . ”
62780	62787	62673	62673	Lucy	129	“ Who may Miss Lavish be ? ”
62788	62803	62742	62742	Lucy	129	“ Oh , a dreadful person — Mr. Emerson , you remember Miss Lavish ? ”
62819	62847	62815	62815	George	126	“ Of course I do . I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street . It was she who told me that you lived here . ”
62848	62854	62855	62855	She	129	“ Were n’t you pleased ? ”
62857	62863	62855	62855	She	129	“ to see Miss Lavish , ”
62907	62915	62916	62916	she	129	“ No wonder the novel ’s bad , ”
62919	62940	62916	62916	she	129	“ I never liked Miss Lavish . But I suppose one ought to read it as one ’s met her . ”
62941	62948	62950	62950	Cecil	256	“ All modern books are bad , ”
62966	62976	62950	62950	Cecil	256	“ Every one writes for money in these days . ”
62977	62983	62916	62916	she	129	“ Oh , Cecil — ! ”
62984	63000	62950	62950	Cecil	256	“ It is so . I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer . ”
63084	63097	63046	63046	his	126	“ How do you like this view of ours , Mr. Emerson ? ”
63098	63107	63046	63046	his	126	“ I never notice much difference in views . ”
63108	63114	63046	63046	his	126	“ What do you mean ? ”
63115	63133	63046	63046	his	126	“ Because they ’re all alike . Because all that matters in them is distance and air . ”
63134	63137	63139	63139	Cecil	256	“ H’m ! ”
63150	63152	63159	63159	he	126	“ My father”—he
63163	63196	63159	63159	he	126	flushed)—“says that there is only one perfect view — the view of the sky straight over our heads , and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it . ”
63197	63207	63209	63209	Cecil	256	“ I expect your father has been reading Dante , ”
63224	63273	63315	63315	He	256	“ He told us another day that views are really crowds — crowds of trees and houses and hills — and are bound to resemble each other , like human crowds — and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural , for the same reason . ”
63279	63314	63315	63315	He	256	“ For a crowd is more than the people who make it up . Something gets added to it — no one knows how — just as something has got added to those hills . ”
63325	63331	63332	63332	she	129	“ What a splendid idea ! ”
63335	63355	63332	63332	she	129	“ I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again . I ’m so sorry he ’s not so well . ”
63356	63364	63315	63315	He	256	“ No , he is n’t well . ”
63365	63378	63380	63380	Cecil	256	“ There ’s an absurd account of a view in this book , ”
63382	63406	63380	63380	Cecil	256	“ Also that men fall into two classes — those who forget views and those who remember them , even in small rooms . ”
63407	63418	63315	63315	He	256	“ Mr. Emerson , have you any brothers or sisters ? ”
63419	63424	63380	63380	Cecil	256	“ None . Why ? ”
63425	63433	63315	63315	He	256	“ You spoke of ‘ us . ’ ”
63434	63442	63380	63380	Cecil	256	“ My mother , I was meaning . ”
63451	63462	63315	63315	He	256	“ Oh , Cecil — how you made me jump ! ”
63463	63475	63315	63315	He	256	“ I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer . ”
63476	63507	63315	63315	He	256	“ I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead . It is the first thing that I remember . ”
63546	63557	63315	63315	He	256	“ Cecil , do read the thing about the view . ”
63558	63569	63512	63513	the man	2468	“ Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us . ”
63570	63601	63315	63315	He	256	“ No — read away . I think nothing ’s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud . If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous , he can go . ”
63631	63641	63642	63642	She	129	“ Mr. Emerson , go and find tennis balls . ”
63697	63704	63706	63706	George	126	“ Am I really to go ? ”
63708	63716	63717	63717	she	129	“ No , of course not really , ”
63720	63724	63726	63726	Cecil	256	“ Chapter two , ”
63730	63743	63726	63726	Cecil	256	“ Find me chapter two , if it is n’t bothering you . ”
63764	63772	63775	63775	her	129	“ Here — hand me the book . ”
63779	63809	63775	63775	her	129	“ It is n’t worth reading — it ’s too silly to read — I never saw such rubbish — it ought n’t to be allowed to be printed . ”
63817	63822	63823	63823	he	256	“ ‘ Leonora , ’ ”
63826	63856	63810	63810	He	256	“ ‘ sat pensive and alone . Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany , dotted over with many a smiling village . The season was spring . ’ ”
63882	63889	63890	63890	he	256	“ ‘ A golden haze , ’ ”
63896	63926	63893	63893	He	256	“ ‘ Afar off the towers of Florence , while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets . All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her — ’ ”
63945	63986	63942	63942	He	256	“ ‘ There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use . No eloquence was his , nor did he suffer from the lack of it . He simply enfolded her in his manly arms . ’ ”
63987	63996	63997	63997	he	256	“ This is n’t the passage I wanted , ”
64001	64011	64012	64012	He	256	“ there is another much funnier , further on . ”
64018	64026	64028	64028	Lucy	129	“ Should we go in to tea ? ”
64106	64109	64110	64110	she	129	“ No — ”
64202	64220	64197	64197	She	129	“ I am not coming in to tea — tell mother — I must write some letters , ”
64352	64357	64363	64363	she	129	“ conquered her breakdown . ”
64448	64455	64456	64456	she	129	“ Something too awful has happened , ”
64466	64477	64456	64456	she	129	“ Do you know anything about Miss Lavish ’s novel ? ”
64508	64529	64486	64486	she	128	“ There is a scene in it . The hero and heroine make love . Do you know about that ? ”
64530	64534	64486	64486	she	128	“ Dear — ? ”
64535	64544	64545	64545	she	129	“ Do you know about it , please ? ”
64548	64562	64545	64545	she	129	“ They are on a hillside , and Florence is in the distance . ”
64563	64581	64486	64486	she	128	“ My good Lucia , I am all at sea . I know nothing about it whatever . ”
64582	64618	64545	64545	she	129	“ There are violets . I can not believe it is a coincidence . Charlotte , Charlotte , how could you have told her ? I have thought before speaking ; it must be you . ”
64619	64624	64625	64625	she	129	“ Told her what ? ”
64632	64640	64545	64545	she	129	“ About that dreadful afternoon in February . ”
64647	64664	64641	64642	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Oh , Lucy , dearest girl — she has n’t put that in her book ? ”
64668	64679	64545	64545	she	129	“ Not so that one could recognize it . Yes . ”
64680	64697	64545	64545	she	129	“ Then never — never — never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine . ”
64698	64704	64545	64545	she	129	“ So you did tell ? ”
64705	64726	64545	64545	she	129	“ I did just happen — when I had tea with her at Rome — in the course of conversation — ”
64727	64760	64545	64545	she	129	“ But Charlotte — what about the promise you gave me when we were packing ? Why did you tell Miss Lavish , when you would n’t even let me tell mother ? ”
64761	64774	64545	64545	she	129	“ I will never forgive Eleanor . She has betrayed my confidence . ”
64775	64791	64545	64545	she	129	“ Why did you tell her , though ? This is a most serious thing . ”
64852	64906	64847	64847	Lucy	129	“ Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson ; it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again . Behind Cecil ’s back . Ugh ! Is it possible that men are such brutes ? Behind Cecil ’s back as we were walking up the garden . ”
64917	64930	64847	64847	Lucy	129	“ What is to be done now ? Can you tell me ? ”
64931	64953	64847	64847	Lucy	129	“ Oh , Lucy — I shall never forgive myself , never to my dying day . Fancy if your prospects — ”
64954	64958	64960	64960	Lucy	129	“ I know , ”
64967	65006	64960	64960	Lucy	129	“ I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil , and what you meant by ‘ some other source . ’ You knew that you had told Miss Lavish , and that she was not reliable . ”
65016	65019	65021	65022	the girl	381	“ However , ”
65030	65056	65021	65022	the girl	381	“ What ’s done ’s done . You have put me in a most awkward position . How am I to get out of it ? ”
65102	65189	65087	65087	She	128	“ He must — that man must have such a setting down that he wo n’t forget . And who ’s to give it him ? I ca n’t tell mother now — owing to you . Nor Cecil , Charlotte , owing to you . I am caught up every way . I think I shall go mad . I have no one to help me . That ’s why I ’ve sent for you . What ’s wanted is a man with a whip . ”
65202	65236	65087	65087	She	128	“ Yes — but it ’s no good agreeing . What ’s to be done ? We women go maundering on . What does a girl do when she comes across a cad ? ”
65237	65274	65087	65087	She	128	“ I always said he was a cad , dear . Give me credit for that , at all events . From the very first moment — when he said his father was having a bath . ”
65275	65325	65087	65087	She	128	“ Oh , bother the credit and who ’s been right or wrong ! We ’ve both made a muddle of it . George Emerson is still down the garden there , and is he to be left unpunished , or is n’t he ? I want to know . ”
65368	65393	65348	65348	She	128	“ You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome . Ca n’t you speak again to him now ? ”
65394	65403	65348	65348	She	128	“ Willingly would I move heaven and earth — ”
65404	65411	65413	65413	Lucy	129	“ I want something more definite , ”
65416	65443	65413	65413	Lucy	129	“ Will you speak to him ? It is the least you can do , surely , considering it all happened because you broke your word . ”
65444	65456	65348	65348	She	128	“ Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine . ”
65464	65475	65348	65348	She	128	“ Yes or no , please ; yes or no . ”
65476	65490	65491	65492	George Emerson	126	“ It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle . ”
65506	65510	65512	65512	Lucy	129	“ Very well , ”
65519	65533	65512	65512	Lucy	129	“ No one will help me . I will speak to him myself . ”
65549	65554	65556	65556	Freddy	135	“ Hullo , Emerson ! ”
65560	65573	65556	65556	Freddy	135	“ Found the lost ball ? Good man ! Want any tea ? ”
65587	65603	65556	65556	Freddy	135	“ Oh , Lucy , but that is brave of you ! I admire you — ”
65667	65707	65655	65655	She	129	“ Freddy has taken him into the dining - room . The others are going down the garden . Come . Let us get this over quickly . Come . I want you in the room , of course . ”
65708	65717	65655	65655	She	129	“ Lucy , do you mind doing it ? ”
65718	65728	65655	65655	She	129	“ How can you ask such a ridiculous question ? ”
65729	65733	65734	65734	She	129	“ Poor Lucy — ”
65740	65752	65734	65734	She	129	“ I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go . ”
65805	65810	65811	65811	Freddy	135	“ Try the jam , ”
65815	65822	65811	65811	Freddy	135	“ The jam ’s jolly good . ”
65849	65856	65843	65843	he	126	“ No — nothing to eat . ”
65857	65865	65867	65867	Lucy	129	“ You go down to the others , ”
65869	65885	65867	65867	Lucy	129	“ Charlotte and I will give Mr. Emerson all he wants . Where ’s mother ? ”
65886	65903	65843	65843	he	126	“ She ’s started on her Sunday writing . She ’s in the drawing - room . ”
65904	65914	65867	65867	Lucy	129	“ That ’s all right . You go away . ”
65958	65995	65954	65954	She	128	“ I ca n’t have it , Mr. Emerson . I can not even talk to you . Go out of this house , and never come into it again as long as I live here — ”
66006	66015	65954	65954	She	128	“ I hate a row . Go please . ”
66016	66019	65954	65954	She	128	“ What — ”
66020	66024	65954	65954	She	128	“ No discussion . ”
66025	66031	65954	65954	She	128	“ But I ca n’t — ”
66037	66052	66032	66032	She	128	“ Go , please . I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse . ”
66053	66059	66060	66060	he	1792	“ You do n’t mean , ”
66066	66079	66109	66109	his	1792	Bartlett—“you do n’t mean that you are going to marry that man ? ”
66097	66103	66104	66104	she	128	“ You are merely ridiculous , ”
66116	66152	66109	66109	his	1792	“ You can not live with Vyse . He ’s only for an acquaintance . He is for society and cultivated talk . He should know no one intimately , least of all a woman . ”
66163	66174	66109	66109	his	1792	“ Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired ? ”
66175	66181	66109	66109	his	1792	“ I can scarcely discuss — ”
66182	66560	66109	66109	his	1792	“ No , but have you ever ? He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things — books , pictures — but kill when they come to people . That ’s why I ’ll speak out through all this muddle even now . It ’s shocking enough to lose you in any case , but generally a man must deny himself joy , and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person . I would never have let myself go . But I saw him first in the National Gallery , when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters . Then he brings us here , and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour . That is the man all over — playing tricks on people , on the most sacred form of life that he can find . Next , I meet you together , and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked , when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no . Cecil all over again . He dare n’t let a woman decide . He ’s the type who ’s kept Europe back for a thousand years . Every moment of his life he ’s forming you , telling you what ’s charming or amusing or ladylike , telling you what a man thinks womanly ; and you , you of all women , listen to his voice instead of to your own . So it was at the Rectory , when I met you both again ; so it has been the whole of this afternoon . Therefore — not ‘ therefore I kissed you , ’ because the book made me do that , and I wish to goodness I had more self - control . I ’m not ashamed . I do n’t apologize . But it has frightened you , and you may not have noticed that I love you . Or would you have told me to go , and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly ? But therefore — therefore I settled to fight him . ”
66569	66595	66597	66597	he	1793	“ You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him , Mr. Emerson . Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit . ”
66611	66617	66608	66608	He	1793	“ Yes , I have , ”
66626	66678	66679	66679	He	1793	“ I ’m the same kind of brute at bottom . This desire to govern a woman — it lies very deep , and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden . But I do love you surely in a better way than he does . ”
66682	66708	66709	66709	He	1793	“ Yes — really in a better way . I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms . ”
66715	66825	66709	66709	He	1793	“ Lucy , be quick — there ’s no time for us to talk now — come to me as you came in the spring , and afterwards I will be gentle and explain . I have cared for you since that man died . I can not live without you , ‘ No good , ’ I thought ; ‘ she is marrying someone else ’ ; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun . As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered . I called . I wanted to live and have my chance of joy . ”
66826	66831	66833	66833	Lucy	129	“ And Mr. Vyse ? ”
66840	66866	66833	66833	Lucy	129	“ Does he not matter ? That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly ? A detail of no importance , I suppose ? ”
66878	66891	66920	66920	he	1796	“ May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition ? ”
66895	66910	66914	66914	he	1796	“ It is our last chance . I shall do all that I can . ”
66938	66951	66952	66952	he	1796	“ You would n’t stop us this second time if you understood , ”
66955	66978	66952	66952	he	1796	“ I have been into the dark , and I am going back into it , unless you will try to understand . ”
67001	67007	67008	67008	he	1796	“ It is being young , ”
67024	67045	67008	67008	he	1796	“ It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really . It is that love and youth matter intellectually . ”
67147	67163	67141	67141	they	1798	“ Oh , Lucia — come back here — oh , what an awful man ! ”
67175	67182	67183	67183	she	129	“ Well , he amuses me , ”
67186	67239	67183	67183	she	129	“ Either I ’m mad , or else he is , and I ’m inclined to think it ’s the latter . One more fuss through with you , Charlotte . Many thanks . I think , though , that this is the last . My admirer will hardly trouble me again . ”
67250	67302	67241	67242	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Well , it is n’t everyone who could boast such a conquest , dearest , is it ? Oh , one ought n’t to laugh , really . It might have been very serious . But you were so sensible and brave — so unlike the girls of my day . ”
67303	67311	67320	67320	she	129	“ Let ’s go down to them . ”
67415	67434	67488	67488	Cecil	256	“ Hullo , Lucy ! There ’s still light enough for another set , if you two’ll hurry . ”
67435	67443	67488	67488	Cecil	256	“ Mr. Emerson has had to go . ”
67444	67487	67488	67488	Cecil	256	“ What a nuisance ! That spoils the four . I say , Cecil , do play , do , there ’s a good chap . It ’s Floyd ’s last day . Do play tennis with us , just this once . ”
67493	67543	67488	67488	Cecil	256	“ My dear Freddy , I am no athlete . As you well remarked this very morning , ‘ There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books ’ ; I plead guilty to being such a chap , and will not inflict myself on you . ”
67673	67681	67682	67682	she	129	“ I am very sorry about it , ”
67685	67719	67682	67682	she	129	“ I have carefully thought things over . We are too different . I must ask you to release me , and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl . ”
67740	67747	67735	67735	her	129	“ Different — how — how — ”
67748	67762	67763	67763	she	129	“ I have n’t had a really good education , for one thing , ”
67774	67812	67763	67763	she	129	“ My Italian trip came too late , and I am forgetting all that I learnt there . I shall never be able to talk to your friends , or behave as a wife of yours should . ”
67813	67832	67735	67735	her	129	“ I do n’t understand you . You are n’t like yourself . You ’re tired , Lucy . ”
67833	67836	67837	67837	she	129	“ Tired ! ”
67844	67862	67837	67837	she	129	“ That is exactly like you . You always think women do n’t mean what they say . ”
67863	67877	67735	67735	her	129	“ Well , you sound tired , as if something has worried you . ”
67878	67911	67837	67837	she	129	“ What if I do ? It does n’t prevent me from realizing the truth . I ca n’t marry you , and you will thank me for saying so some day . ”
67912	67921	67922	67922	she	129	“ You had that bad headache yesterday — All right”—for
67927	67945	67922	67922	she	129	“ I see it ’s much more than headaches . But give me a moment ’s time . ”
67951	68006	67946	67946	He	1807	“ You must excuse me if I say stupid things , but my brain has gone to pieces . Part of it lives three minutes back , when I was sure that you loved me , and the other part — I find it difficult — I am likely to say the wrong thing . ”
68042	68104	68039	68039	she	129	“ There are days when one sees clearly , and this is one of them . Things must come to a breaking - point some time , and it happens to be to - day . If you want to know , quite a little thing decided me to speak to you — when you would n’t play tennis with Freddy . ”
68105	68112	68114	68114	Cecil	256	“ I never do play tennis , ”
68119	68134	68114	68114	Cecil	256	“ I never could play . I do n’t understand a word you say . ”
68135	68155	68039	68039	she	129	“ You can play well enough to make up a four . I thought it abominably selfish of you . ”
68156	68201	68114	68114	Cecil	256	“ No , I can’t — well , never mind the tennis . Why could n’t you — couldn’t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong ? You talked of our wedding at lunch — at least , you let me talk . ”
68202	68210	68212	68212	Lucy	129	“ I knew you would n’t understand , ”
68216	68265	68212	68212	Lucy	129	“ I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations . Of course , it is n’t the tennis — that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks . Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain . ”
68271	68377	68266	68266	She	129	“ Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife — for instance , in London ; and are you fitted to be my husband ? I do n’t think so . You do n’t like Freddy , nor my mother . There was always a lot against our engagement , Cecil , but all our relations seemed pleased , and we met so often , and it was no good mentioning it until — well , until all things came to a point . They have to - day . I see clearly . I must speak . That ’s all . ”
68378	68387	68389	68389	Cecil	256	“ I can not think you were right , ”
68392	68424	68389	68389	Cecil	256	“ I can not tell why , but though all that you say sounds true , I feel that you are not treating me fairly . It ’s all too horrible . ”
68425	68434	68266	68266	She	129	“ What ’s the good of a scene ? ”
68435	68451	68389	68389	Cecil	256	“ No good . But surely I have a right to hear a little more . ”
68492	68496	68266	68266	She	129	“ little more , ”
68503	68528	68529	68529	He	256	“ Do n’t open the window ; and you ’d better draw the curtain , too ; Freddy or any one might be outside . ”
68532	68577	68529	68529	He	256	“ I really think we had better go to bed , if you do n’t mind . I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards . As you say it is all too horrible , and it is no good talking . ”
68661	68675	68658	68658	he	256	“ But I love you , and I did think you loved me ! ”
68676	68681	68682	68682	she	1808	“ I did not , ”
68685	68709	68682	68682	she	1808	“ I thought I did at first . I am sorry , and ought to have refused you this last time , too . ”
68765	68795	68753	68753	she	1808	“ You do n’t love me , evidently . I dare say you are right not to . But it would hurt a little less if I knew why . ”
68796	68797	68823	68823	his	256	“ Because”—a
68806	68817	68823	68823	his	256	it—“you’re the sort who ca n’t know any one intimately . ”
68826	68881	68882	68882	Her	1808	“ I do n’t mean exactly that . But you will question me , though I beg you not to , and I must say something . It is that , more or less . When we were only acquaintances , you let me be myself , but now you ’re always protecting me . ”
68886	68958	68882	68882	Her	1808	“ I wo n’t be protected . I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right . To shield me is an insult . Ca n’t I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second - hand through you ? A woman ’s place ! You despise my mother — I know you do — because she ’s conventional and bothers over puddings ; but , oh goodness!”—she
68962	69061	69062	69062	She	1808	feet—“conventional , Cecil , you ’re that , for you may understand beautiful things , but you do n’t know how to use them ; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music , and would try to wrap up me . I wo n’t be stifled , not by the most glorious music , for people are more glorious , and you hide them from me . That ’s why I break off my engagement . You were all right as long as you kept to things , but when you came to people — ”
69077	69082	69071	69071	Cecil	256	“ It is true . ”
69083	69089	69090	69090	she	1808	“ True on the whole , ”
69099	69114	69071	69071	Cecil	256	“ True , every word . It is a revelation . It is — I. ”
69115	69128	69071	69071	Cecil	256	“ Anyhow , those are my reasons for not being your wife . ”
69132	69180	69129	69129	He	256	“ ‘ The sort that can know no one intimately . ’ It is true . I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged . I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother . You are even greater than I thought . ”
69186	69295	69181	69181	She	1808	“ I ’m not going to worry you . You are far too good to me . I shall never forget your insight ; and , dear , I only blame you for this : you might have warned me in the early stages , before you felt you would n’t marry me , and so have given me a chance to improve . I have never known you till this evening . I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be . But this evening you are a different person : new thoughts — even a new voice — ”
69296	69306	69307	69307	she	1812	“ What do you mean by a new voice ? ”
69315	69327	69329	69329	he	1813	“ I mean that a new person seems speaking through you , ”
69340	69359	69337	69337	She	1812	“ If you think I am in love with some one else , you are very much mistaken . ”
69360	69377	69181	69181	She	1808	“ Of course I do n’t think that . You are not that kind , Lucy . ”
69378	69465	69337	69337	She	1812	“ Oh , yes , you do think it . It ’s your old idea , the idea that has kept Europe back — I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men . If a girl breaks off her engagement , everyone says : ‘ Oh , she had someone else in her mind ; she hopes to get someone else . ’ It ’s disgusting , brutal ! As if a girl ca n’t break it off for the sake of freedom . ”
69470	69493	69466	69466	He	1814	“ I may have said that in the past . I shall never say it again . You have taught me better . ”
69507	69567	69181	69181	She	1808	“ Of course , there is no question of ‘ someone else ’ in this , no ‘ jilting ’ or any such nauseous stupidity . I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was . I only meant that there was a force in you that I had n’t known of up till now . ”
69568	69589	69633	69633	His	1816	“ All right , Cecil , that will do . Do n’t apologize to me . It was my mistake . ”
69590	69632	69633	69633	His	1816	“ It is a question between ideals , yours and mine — pure abstract ideals , and yours are the nobler . I was bound up in the old vicious notions , and all the time you were splendid and new . ”
69637	69674	69633	69633	His	1816	“ I must actually thank you for what you have done — for showing me what I really am . Solemnly , I thank you for showing me a true woman . Will you shake hands ? ”
69675	69681	69683	69683	Lucy	129	“ Of course I will , ”
69694	69724	69683	69683	Lucy	129	“ Good - night , Cecil . Good - bye . That ’s all right . I ’m sorry about it . Thank you very much for your gentleness . ”
69725	69735	69736	69736	They	1817	“ Let me light your candle , shall I ? ”
69742	69757	69736	69736	They	1817	“ Thank you . Good - night again . God bless you , Lucy ! ”
69758	69765	69736	69736	They	1817	“ Good - bye , Cecil . ”
70325	70328	70351	70352	expensive architects	1852	“ did , ”
70446	70457	70459	70460	Miss Catharine	167	“ Since Florence did my poor sister so much good , ”
70462	70528	70459	70460	Miss Catharine	167	“ we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter . Of course , Athens is a plunge , and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread ; but , after all , we can take that with us , and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train . But is there an English Church ? ”
70537	70568	70459	70460	Miss Catharine	167	“ I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens , but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople , we should be so grateful . ”
70915	70927	70928	70928	he	380	“ So you ’re off for a minute , Mr. Vyse ? ”
70934	70937	70931	70931	Cecil	256	“ Yes , ”
70943	70960	70961	70961	He	380	“ I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch . ”
70966	71005	70961	70961	He	380	“ Is n’t it wonderful ? Is n’t it romance ? Most certainly they will go to Constantinople . They are taken in a snare that can not fail . They will end by going round the world . ”
71023	71124	71012	71012	he	256	“ Is n’t Romance capricious ! I never notice it in you young people ; you do nothing but play lawn tennis , and say that romance is dead , while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing . ‘ A really comfortable pension at Constantinople ! ’ So they call it out of decency , but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn ! No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans . They want the Pension Keats . ”
71125	71136	71138	71138	Freddy	135	“ I ’m awfully sorry to interrupt , Mr. Beebe , ”
71140	71147	71138	71138	Freddy	135	“ but have you any matches ? ”
71148	71152	71154	71154	Cecil	256	“ I have , ”
71174	71189	71166	71166	he	133	“ You have never met these Miss Alans , have you , Mr. Vyse ? ”
71190	71193	71012	71012	he	256	“ Never . ”
71194	71326	71327	71327	He	1877	“ Then you do n’t see the wonder of this Greek visit . I have n’t been to Greece myself , and do n’t mean to go , and I ca n’t imagine any of my friends going . It is altogether too big for our little lot . Do n’t you think so ? Italy is just about as much as we can manage . Italy is heroic , but Greece is godlike or devilish — I am not sure which , and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus . All right , Freddy — I am not being clever , upon my word I am not — I took the idea from another fellow ; and give me those matches when you ’ve done with them . ”
71342	71410	71327	71327	He	1877	“ I was saying , if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background , let it be Italian . Big enough in all conscience . The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me . There the contrast is just as much as I can realize . But not the Parthenon , not the frieze of Phidias at any price ; and here comes the victoria . ”
71411	71417	71419	71419	Cecil	256	“ You ’re quite right , ”
71421	71429	71432	71432	he	256	“ Greece is not for our little lot ”
71494	71536	71491	71491	he	1877	“ I ’m so glad you only talked about books . Cecil ’s hard hit . Lucy wo n’t marry him . If you ’d gone on about her , as you did about them , he might have broken down . ”
71537	71541	71491	71491	he	1877	“ But when — ”
71542	71551	71491	71491	he	1877	“ Late last night . I must go . ”
71552	71562	71491	71491	he	1877	“ Perhaps they wo n’t want me down there . ”
71563	71573	71491	71491	he	1877	“ No — go on . Good - bye . ”
71574	71578	71583	71583	himself	133	“ Thank goodness ! ”
71594	71612	71590	71590	his	133	“ It was the one foolish thing she ever did . Oh , what a glorious riddance ! ”
71744	71749	71743	71752	the “ garden - child , ” a minute importation	1886	“ garden - child , ”
71765	71840	71889	71890	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Oh , how do you do , Mr. Beebe ? Gracious what a mess everything is ! Look at my scarlet pompoms , and the wind blowing your skirts about , and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in , and then the carriage having to go out , when I had counted on having Powell , who — give everyone their due — does tie up dahlias properly . ”
71847	71853	71855	71856	Miss Bartlett	128	“ How do you do ? ”
71879	71887	71889	71890	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Here , Lennie , the bass , ”
71947	71955	71956	71956	he	1888	“ Come for a walk with me , ”
71960	71997	71956	71956	he	1888	“ You have worried them as much as they can stand . Mrs. Honeychurch , I only called in aimlessly . I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern , if I may . ”
71998	72038	71956	71956	he	1888	“ Oh , must you ? Yes do.—Not the scissors , thank you , Charlotte , when both my hands are full already — I’m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it . ”
72061	72092	72107	72107	she	128	“ Yes , Charlotte , I do n’t want you — do go ; there ’s nothing to stop about for , either in the house or out of it . ”
72169	72180	72181	72181	he	133	“ It is terrible , this havoc among the flowers , ”
72184	72200	72202	72203	Miss Bartlett	128	“ It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment , ”
72205	72225	72202	72203	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother . Or will she come with us ? ”
72226	72243	72181	72181	he	133	“ I think we had better leave Lucy to herself , and to her own pursuits . ”
72244	72258	72260	72260	Minnie	248	“ They ’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast , ”
72262	72299	72260	72260	Minnie	248	“ and Floyd has gone , and Mr. Vyse has gone , and Freddy wo n’t play with me . In fact , Uncle Arthur , the house is not at all what it was yesterday . ”
72300	72307	72311	72311	Arthur	312	“ Do n’t be a prig , ”
72313	72321	72311	72311	Arthur	312	“ Go and put on your boots . ”
72347	72372	72322	72322	He	312	“ How do you do ? Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive . Would you come too ? ”
72373	72384	72322	72322	He	312	“ I do n’t think I will , thank you . ”
72385	72398	72322	72322	He	312	“ No , I did n’t suppose you would care to much . ”
72410	72417	72419	72420	Mr. Beebe	133	“ How delicate those Sonatas are ! ”
72442	72446	72440	72440	Schumann	268	“ Miss Honeychurch ! ”
72447	72450	72440	72440	Schumann	268	“ Yes . ”
72451	72464	72440	72440	Schumann	268	“ I met them on the hill . Your brother told me . ”
72465	72470	72471	72471	She	129	“ Oh he did ? ”
72493	72505	72440	72440	Schumann	268	“ I need n’t say that it will go no further . ”
72506	72517	72519	72519	Lucy	129	“ Mother , Charlotte , Cecil , Freddy , you , ”
72537	72563	72440	72440	Schumann	268	“ If you ’ll let me say so , I am very glad , and I am certain that you have done the right thing . ”
72564	72580	72440	72440	Schumann	268	“ So I hoped other people would think , but they do n’t seem to . ”
72581	72592	72440	72440	Schumann	268	“ I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise . ”
72593	72602	72440	72440	Schumann	268	“ So does mother . Mother minds dreadfully . ”
72603	72611	72613	72614	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I am very sorry for that , ”
72678	72683	72724	72724	Minnie	248	“ And Freddy minds . ”
72684	72716	72724	72724	Minnie	248	“ Still , Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much , did he ? I gathered that he disliked the engagement , and felt it might separate him from you . ”
72717	72723	72724	72724	Minnie	248	“ Boys are so odd . ”
72776	72803	72773	72773	he	133	“ I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan . That was really what brought me over . I thought it might amuse you all . ”
72804	72808	72810	72810	Lucy	129	“ How delightful ! ”
72848	72857	72844	72844	she	129	“ Going abroad ? When do they start ? ”
72858	72865	72844	72844	she	129	“ Next week , I gather . ”
72866	72877	72844	72844	she	129	“ Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back ? ”
72878	72885	72844	72844	she	129	“ No , he did n’t . ”
72886	72897	72844	72844	she	129	“ Because I do hope he wo n’t go gossiping . ”
72929	72950	72919	72919	she	129	“ Oh , do tell me more about the Miss Alans ! How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad ! ”
72951	72971	72844	72844	she	129	“ I want them to start from Venice , and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast ! ”
72976	72988	72972	72972	She	129	“ Oh , delightful ! I wish they ’d take me . ”
72989	73019	72919	72919	she	129	“ Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel ? Perhaps George Emerson is right . He says that ‘ Italy is only an euphuism for Fate . ’ ”
73020	73047	72972	72972	She	129	“ Oh , not Italy , but Constantinople . I have always longed to go to Constantinople . Constantinople is practically Asia , is n’t it ? ”
73068	73080	73060	73062	the Miss Alans	171	“ with Delphi , perhaps , if the roads are safe . ”
73117	73137	73112	73112	she	129	“ I did n’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends , after Cissie Villa . ”
73138	73164	73104	73104	He	133	“ Oh , that ’s nothing ; I assure you Cissie Villa ’s nothing to me ; I would give anything to go with them . ”
73165	73183	73112	73112	she	129	“ Would your mother spare you again so soon ? You have scarcely been home three months . ”
73184	73190	73192	73192	Lucy	129	“ She must spare me ! ”
73198	73209	73192	73192	Lucy	129	“ I simply must go away . I have to . ”
73219	73250	73212	73212	her	129	“ Do n’t you see that I have to go away ? I did n’t realize at the time — and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly . ”
73251	73265	73298	73298	Cecil	256	“ You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel — ”
73266	73277	73212	73212	her	129	“ Yes , yes . I knew you ’d understand . ”
73340	73363	73327	73327	He	256	“ Yes , of course ; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down . ”
73364	73375	73376	73376	he	256	“ I am afraid it has been a bothersome business , ”
73380	73476	73327	73327	He	256	“ No , not at all . Cecil was very kind indeed ; only — I had better tell you the whole truth , since you have heard a little — it was that he is so masterful . I found that he would n’t let me go my own way . He would improve me in places where I ca n’t be improved . Cecil wo n’t let a woman decide for herself — in fact , he dare n’t . What nonsense I do talk ! But that is the kind of thing . ”
73477	73536	73327	73327	He	256	“ It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse ; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you . I do sympathize and agree most profoundly . I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism : Is it worth while rushing off to Greece ? ”
73537	73544	73545	73545	she	1902	“ But I must go somewhere ! ”
73548	73564	73565	73565	She	1902	“ I have been worrying all the morning , and here comes the very thing . ”
73576	73617	73565	73565	She	1902	“ I must ! And the time I shall have with mother , and all the money she spent on me last spring . You all think much too highly of me . I wish you were n’t so kind . ”
73630	73653	73621	73622	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I must get away , ever so far . I must know my own mind and where I want to go . ”
73654	73664	73666	73667	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Come along ; tea , tea , tea , ”
73712	73718	73719	73719	he	133	“ She is playing again , ”
73725	73731	73719	73719	he	133	“ Lucy can always play , ”
73737	73793	73719	73719	he	133	“ One is very thankful that she has such a resource . She is evidently much worried , as , of course , she ought to be . I know all about it . The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak . ”
73826	73840	73817	73817	he	133	“ she might yet reveal depths of strangeness , if not of meaning . ”
73880	73890	73874	73874	She	248	“ We had much better let the matter drop . ”
73891	73895	73874	73874	She	248	“ I wonder . ”
73896	73929	73874	73874	She	248	“ It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street . It would be death to gossip about Mr. Vyse ’s dismissal at the present moment . ”
73956	73989	73953	73953	He	133	“ Of course , Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way , and when she chooses . Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind . ”
73990	73994	73996	73997	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I know , ”
74000	74018	73996	73997	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you . One can not be too careful . ”
74019	74023	73953	73953	He	133	“ Quite so . ”
74024	74041	73996	73997	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I do implore absolute secrecy . A chance word to a chattering friend , and — ”
74042	74045	73953	73953	He	133	“ Exactly . ”
74106	74187	74100	74101	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately ? I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish . It is odd how we of that pension , who seemed such a fortuitous collection , have been working into one another ’s lives . Two , three , four , six of us — no , eight ; I had forgotten the Emersons — have kept more or less in touch . We must really give the Signora a testimonial . ”
74369	74395	74366	74366	he	133	“ We sha n’t have rain , but we shall have darkness , so let us hurry on . The darkness last night was appalling . ”
74502	74511	74512	74512	he	133	“ I have been thinking , Miss Bartlett , ”
74515	74532	74512	74512	he	133	“ and , unless you very much object , I would like to reopen that discussion . ”
74536	74603	74604	74604	He	133	“ Nothing about the past . I know little and care less about that ; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin ’s credit . She has acted loftily and rightly , and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her . But the future . Seriously , what do you think of this Greek plan ? ”
74611	74646	74604	74604	He	133	“ I do n’t know whether you overheard , but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career . It ’s all — I ca n’t explain — it ’s wrong . ”
74669	74680	74647	74648	Miss Bartlett	128	“ I ca n’t see the point of it myself . ”
74688	74705	74685	74685	she	128	“ There I can not agree with you . In it I spy Lucy ’s salvation . ”
74706	74713	74685	74685	she	128	“ Really . Now , why ? ”
74714	74722	74685	74685	she	128	“ She wanted to leave Windy Corner . ”
74723	74747	74685	74685	she	128	“ I know — but it seems so odd , so unlike her , so — I was going to say — selfish . ”
74748	74767	74685	74685	she	128	“ It is natural , surely — after such painful scenes — that she should desire a change . ”
74787	74841	74783	74784	Mr. Beebe	133	“ So she says herself , and since another lady agrees with her , I must own that I am partially convinced . Perhaps she must have a change . I have no sisters or — and I do n’t understand these things . But why need she go as far as Greece ? ”
74842	74849	74851	74852	Miss Bartlett	128	“ You may well ask that , ”
74867	74949	74851	74852	Miss Bartlett	128	“ Why Greece ? ( What is it , Minnie dear — jam ? ) Why not Tunbridge Wells ? Oh , Mr. Beebe ! I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning . I can not help her . I will say no more . Perhaps I have already said too much . I am not to talk . I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells , and she refused . ”
74960	75022	74957	74957	his	133	“ But my feelings are of no importance . I know too well that I get on Lucy ’s nerves . Our tour was a failure . She wanted to leave Florence , and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome , and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother ’s money—. ”
75023	75033	75035	75036	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Let us keep to the future , though , ”
75038	75044	75035	75036	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I want your advice . ”
75045	75049	75051	75051	Charlotte	128	“ Very well , ”
75068	75083	75051	75051	Charlotte	128	“ I for one will help her to go to Greece . Will you ? ”
75088	75094	75095	75095	she	128	“ It is absolutely necessary , ”
75116	75123	75095	75095	she	128	“ I know — I know . ”
75141	75199	75134	75136	this odd woman	1922	“ She must not stop here a moment , and we must keep quiet till she goes . I trust that the servants know nothing . Afterwards — but I may have said too much already . Only , Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone . If you help we may succeed . Otherwise — ”
75200	75204	75228	75229	the clergyman	380	“ Otherwise — ? ”
75205	75208	75209	75209	she	128	“ Otherwise , ”
75218	75226	75228	75229	the clergyman	380	“ Yes , I will help her , ”
75236	75252	75228	75229	the clergyman	380	“ Come , let us go back now , and settle the whole thing up . ”
75308	75311	75277	75277	she	128	“ another man ”
75390	75404	75361	75361	His	133	“ They that marry do well , but they that refrain do better . ”
75603	75609	75610	75610	she	134	“ It gets too dark , ”
75614	75652	75610	75610	she	134	“ This comes of putting off . We might have known the weather would break up soon ; and now Lucy wants to go to Greece . I do n’t know what the world ’s coming to . ”
75653	75657	75658	75658	he	135	“ Mrs. Honeychurch , ”
75661	75694	75658	75658	he	135	“ go to Greece she must . Come up to the house and let ’s talk it over . Do you , in the first place , mind her breaking with Vyse ? ”
75695	75706	75610	75610	she	134	“ Mr. Beebe , I ’m thankful — simply thankful . ”
75707	75712	75714	75714	Freddy	135	“ So am I , ”
75716	75726	75610	75610	she	134	“ Good . Now come up to the house . ”
75813	75823	75824	75824	she	129	“ I do n’t see why Greece is necessary , ”
75827	75858	75824	75824	she	129	“ but as you do , I suppose it is all right . It must be something I ca n’t understand . Lucy ! Let ’s tell her . Lucy ! ”
75859	75866	75867	75868	Mr. Beebe	133	“ She is playing the piano , ”
75884	75893	75871	75871	He	133	“ Look not thou on beauty ’s charming . ”
75894	75906	75867	75868	Mr. Beebe	133	“ I did n’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang , too . ”
75907	75926	75871	75871	He	133	“ Sit thou still when kings are arming , Taste not when the wine - cup glistens — — ”
75927	75942	75867	75868	Mr. Beebe	133	“ It ’s a song that Cecil gave her . How odd girls are ! ”
75943	75948	75950	75950	Lucy	129	“ What ’s that ? ”
75955	75961	75963	75964	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ All right , dear , ”
75985	76006	75979	75979	her	134	“ I am sorry I was so cross about Greece , but it came on the top of the dahlias . ”
76013	76026	75979	75979	her	134	“ Thank you , mother ; that does n’t matter a bit . ”
76027	76052	76064	76065	Mr. Beebe	133	“ And you are right , too — Greece will be all right ; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you . ”
76053	76063	75979	75979	her	134	“ Oh , splendid ! Oh , thank you ! ”
76207	76224	76225	76225	she	129	“ Taste not when the wine - cup glistens , Speak not when the people listens , ”
76228	76234	76225	76225	she	129	“ Here ’s Mr. Beebe . ”
76235	76243	76225	76225	she	129	“ Mr. Beebe knows my rude ways . ”
76244	76255	76257	76257	he	1945	“ It ’s a beautiful song and a wise one , ”
76259	76263	76257	76257	he	1945	“ Go on . ”
76264	76271	76272	76272	she	129	“ It is n’t very good , ”
76276	76285	76272	76272	she	129	“ I forget why — harmony or something . ”
76286	76298	76225	76225	she	129	“ I suspected it was unscholarly . It ’s so beautiful . ”
76299	76306	76308	76308	Freddy	135	“ The tune ’s right enough , ”
76310	76323	76308	76308	Freddy	135	“ but the words are rotten . Why throw up the sponge ? ”
76324	76330	76332	76333	his sister	906	“ How stupidly you talk ! ”
76391	76401	76370	76370	Freddy	135	“ This has been a day and a half . ”
76402	76410	76383	76383	his	135	“ Stop thine ear against the singer — ”
76411	76420	76370	76370	Freddy	135	“ Wait a minute ; she is finishing . ”
76421	76442	76383	76383	his	135	“ From the red gold keep thy finger ; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die . ”
76443	76450	76452	76452	Freddy	135	“ I love weather like this , ”
76518	76526	76511	76511	she	129	“ Vacant heart and hand and eye — ”
76531	76535	76511	76511	she	129	“ the better part ”
76575	76588	76511	76511	she	129	“ Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die . ”
76766	76797	76759	76759	Lucy	129	“ But , of course , you know all about these things , and you have Mr. Vyse to help you . A gentleman is such a stand - by . ”
76821	76834	76835	76836	Miss Catharine	167	“ We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you , ”
76839	76864	76835	76836	Miss Catharine	167	“ It is not every young man who would be so unselfish . But perhaps he will come out and join you later on . ”
76865	76875	76877	76878	Miss Teresa	166	“ Or does his work keep him in London ? ”
76891	76912	76835	76836	Miss Catharine	167	“ However , we shall see him when he sees you off . I do so long to see him . ”
76913	76921	76923	76924	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ No one will see Lucy off , ”
76926	76933	76923	76924	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ She does n’t like it . ”
76934	76943	76945	76945	Lucy	129	“ No , I hate seeings - off , ”
76947	76962	76923	76924	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Really ? How funny ! I should have thought that in this case — ”
76963	76984	76923	76924	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ Oh , Mrs. Honeychurch , you are n’t going ? It is such a pleasure to have met you ! ”
76994	77007	76989	76989	Lucy	129	“ That ’s all right . We just got through that time . ”
77014	77078	77009	77010	her mother	493	“ I should be told , dear , that I am unsympathetic . But I can not see why you did n’t tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it . There all the time we had to sit fencing , and almost telling lies , and be seen through , too , I dare say , which is most unpleasant . ”
77115	77127	77087	77087	She	129	“ But why should n’t it be everywhere in no time ? ”
77128	77165	77196	77196	she	129	“ Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England . I shall tell them then . It ’s much pleasanter . How wet it is ! Let ’s turn in here . ”
77166	77168	77087	77087	She	129	“ Here ”
77228	77255	77356	77356	Lucy	129	“ Oh , well , let it be shop , then . Let ’s go to Mudie ’s . I ’ll buy a guide - book . ”
77256	77338	77356	77356	Lucy	129	“ You know , Lucy , you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I ’m so stupid , so I suppose I am , but I shall never understand this hole - and - corner work . You ’ve got rid of Cecil — well and good , and I ’m thankful he ’s gone , though I did feel angry for the minute . But why not announce it ? Why this hushing up and tip - toeing ? ”
77339	77348	77356	77356	Lucy	129	“ It ’s only for a few days . ”
77349	77355	77356	77356	Lucy	129	“ But why at all ? ”
77375	77395	77356	77356	Lucy	129	“ Because George Emerson has been bothering me , and if he hears I ’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite
77465	77504	77461	77461	She	134	“ My daughter wo n’t answer me ; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me . Any rag , tag , and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home . ”
77521	77529	77516	77516	she	134	“ You ’re tired of Windy Corner . ”
77617	77676	77613	77613	She	129	“ I do not love George ; I broke off my engagement because I did not love George ; I must go to Greece because I do not love George ; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother ; everyone else is behaving very badly . ”
77706	77726	77700	77700	she	129	“ Oh , mother , what rubbish you talk ! Of course I ’m not tired of Windy Corner . ”
77727	77743	77789	77789	She	129	“ Then why not say so at once , instead of considering half an hour ? ”
77748	77756	77744	77744	She	129	“ Half a minute would be nearer . ”
77757	77770	77700	77700	she	129	“ Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether ? ”
77771	77780	77744	77744	She	129	“ Hush , mother ! People will hear you ”
77797	77847	77789	77789	She	129	“ Of course I want to live at home ; but as we are talking about it , I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been . You see , I come into my money next year . ”
77868	77871	77872	77872	Lucy	129	“ eccentricity , ”
77880	77942	77872	77872	Lucy	129	“ I ’ve seen the world so little — I felt so out of things in Italy . I have seen so little of life ; one ought to come up to London more — not a cheap ticket like to - day , but to stop . I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl . ”
77943	77953	77955	77956	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ And mess with typewriters and latch - keys , ”
77958	78038	77955	77956	Mrs. Honeychurch	134	“ And agitate and scream , and be carried off kicking by the police . And call it a Mission — when no one wants you ! And call it Duty — when it means that you ca n’t stand your own home ! And call it Work — when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is ! And then to prepare yourself , find two doddering old ladies , and go abroad with them . ”
78039	78045	78047	78047	Lucy	129	“ I want more independence , ”
78111	78172	78108	78108	her	129	“ Very well . Take your independence and be gone . Rush up and down and round the world , and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food . Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted , and our dear view — and then share a flat with another girl . ”
78181	78187	78173	78173	Lucy	129	“ Perhaps I spoke hastily . ”
78188	78193	78194	78195	her mother	493	“ Oh , goodness ! ”
78198	78208	78194	78195	her mother	493	“ How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett ! ”
78209	78212	78214	78214	Lucy	129	“ Charlotte ? ”
78227	78232	78173	78173	Lucy	129	“ More every moment . ”
78233	78254	78194	78195	her mother	493	“ I do n’t know what you mean , mother ; Charlotte and I are not the very least alike . ”
78255	78292	78173	78173	Lucy	129	“ Well , I see the likeness . The same eternal worrying , the same taking back of words . You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters . ”
78293	78339	78194	78195	her mother	493	“ What rubbish ! And if you dislike Charlotte so , it ’s rather a pity you asked her to stop . I warned you about her ; I begged you , implored you not to , but of course it was not listened to . ”
78340	78345	78173	78173	Lucy	129	“ There you go . ”
78346	78352	78194	78195	her mother	493	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
78353	78368	78173	78173	Lucy	129	“ Charlotte again , my dear ; that ’s all ; her very words . ”
78374	78398	78369	78369	Lucy	129	“ My point is that you ought n’t to have asked Charlotte to stop . I wish you would keep to the point . ”
78508	78519	78520	78520	she	129	“ The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable , ”
78557	78586	78551	78552	Mr. Beebe	133	“ We shall have to sit three a side , because the trees drop , and yet it is n’t raining . Oh , for a little air ! ”

78614	78623	78624	78624	she	129	“ Ca n’t we have the hood down ? ”
78637	78648	78624	78624	she	129	“ Very well , old lady , stop the horse . ”
78714	78724	78725	78725	she	129	“ Is that house to let again , Powell ? ”
78728	78733	78734	78734	he	310	“ Yes , miss , ”
78737	78742	78804	78804	Lucy	129	“ Have they gone ? ”
78743	78781	78804	78804	Lucy	129	“ It is too far out of town for the young gentleman , and his father ’s rheumatism has come on , so he ca n’t stop on alone , so they are trying to let furnished , ”
78786	78793	78804	78804	Lucy	129	“ They have gone , then ? ”
78794	78803	78804	78804	Lucy	129	“ Yes , miss , they have gone . ”
78967	78970	78972	78973	the hostess	2002	“ Certainly , ”
78976	78996	78972	78973	the hostess	2002	“ I forgot it was Friday . Let ’s all go . Powell can go round to the stables . ”
78997	79001	78972	78973	the hostess	2002	“ Lucy dearest — ”
79002	79011	78972	78973	the hostess	2002	“ No church for me , thank you . ”
79168	79176	79156	79157	Some one	2397	“ A lady to wait , sir . ”
79195	79206	79207	79207	he	289	“ Oh , Miss Honeychurch , that you should come ! ”
79251	79308	79230	79230	George	126	“ Miss Honeychurch , dear , we are so sorry ! George is so sorry ! He thought he had a right to try . I can not blame my boy , and yet I wish he had told me first . He ought not to have tried . I knew nothing about it at all . ”
79324	79332	79318	79318	He	395	“ But you must not scold him . ”
79348	79353	79354	79354	he	395	“ I taught him , ”
79357	79409	79354	79354	he	395	“ to trust in love . I said : ‘ When love comes , that is reality . ’ I said : ‘ Passion does not blind . No . Passion is sanity , and the woman you love , she is the only person you will ever really understand . ’ ”
79413	79463	79410	79410	He	395	“ True , everlastingly true , though my day is over , and though there is the result . Poor boy ! He is so sorry ! He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in ; that whatever you felt you did not mean . Yet”—his
79473	79481	79468	79468	he	395	certain—“Miss Honeychurch , do you remember Italy ? ”
79504	79520	79501	79501	she	129	“ I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son . ”
79521	79528	79501	79501	she	129	“ But you do remember it ? ”
79529	79538	79501	79501	she	129	“ He has misbehaved himself from the first . ”
79539	79565	79501	79501	she	129	“ I only was told that he loved you last Sunday . I never could judge behaviour . I — I — suppose he has . ”
79606	79614	79615	79615	she	129	“ Why , he has behaved abominably , ”
79618	79633	79615	79615	she	129	“ I am glad he is sorry . Do you know what he did ? ”
79634	79640	79582	79582	His	2015	“ Not ‘ abominably , ’ ”
79646	79689	79582	79582	His	2015	“ He only tried when he should not have tried . You have all you want , Miss Honeychurch : you are going to marry the man you love . Do not go out of George ’s life saying he is abominable . ”
79690	79696	79698	79698	Lucy	129	“ No , of course , ”
79707	79753	79698	79698	Lucy	129	“ ‘ Abominable ’ is much too strong . I am sorry I used it about your son . I think I will go to church , after all . My mother and my cousin have gone . I shall not be so very late — ”
79754	79762	79763	79763	he	256	“ Especially as he has gone under , ”
79767	79772	79698	79698	Lucy	129	“ What was that ? ”
79773	79778	79779	79779	He	256	“ Gone under naturally . ”
79794	79800	79698	79698	Lucy	129	“ I do n’t understand . ”
79801	79807	79698	79698	Lucy	129	“ As his mother did . ”
79808	79823	79698	79698	Lucy	129	“ But , Mr. Emerson — Mr. Emerson — what are you talking about ? ”
79824	79833	79835	79835	he	256	“ When I would n’t have George baptized , ”
79841	79870	79871	79871	He	256	“ And she agreed that baptism was nothing , but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round . She thought it a judgement . ”
79874	79972	79871	79871	He	256	“ Oh , horrible , when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents . Oh , horrible — worst of all — worse than death , when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness , planted your little garden , let in your sunlight , and then the weeds creep in again ! A judgement ! And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church ! Is it possible , Miss Honeychurch ? Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever ? ”
79973	79979	79981	79981	Lucy	129	“ I do n’t know , ”
79983	80001	79981	79981	Lucy	129	“ I do n’t understand this sort of thing . I was not meant to understand it . ”
80002	80056	79871	79871	He	256	“ But Mr. Eager — he came when I was out , and acted according to his principles . I do n’t blame him or any one ... but by the time George was well she was ill . He made her think about sin , and she went under thinking about it . ”
80073	80079	80081	80081	Lucy	129	“ Oh , how terrible ! ”
80090	80096	80098	80100	the old man	360	“ He was not baptized , ”
80102	80108	80098	80100	the old man	360	“ I did hold firm . ”
80134	80145	80110	80110	he	360	“ My boy shall go back to the earth untouched . ”
80155	80161	80162	80162	He	360	“ Oh — last Sunday . ”
80168	80259	80162	80162	He	360	“ George last Sunday — no , not ill : just gone under . He is never ill . But he is his mother ’s son . Her eyes were his , and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful , and he will not think it worth while to live . It was always touch and go . He will live ; but he will not think it worth while to live . He will never think anything worth while . You remember that church at Florence ? ”
80276	80308	80266	80266	she	129	“ After you left Florence — horrible . Then we took the house here , and he goes bathing with your brother , and became better . You saw him bathing ? ”
80309	80331	80266	80266	she	129	“ I am so sorry , but it is no good discussing this affair . I am deeply sorry about it . ”
80332	80410	80266	80266	she	129	“ Then there came something about a novel . I did n’t follow it at all ; I had to hear so much , and he minded telling me ; he finds me too old . Ah , well , one must have failures . George comes down to - morrow , and takes me up to his London rooms . He ca n’t bear to be about here , and I must be where he is . ”
80411	80415	80417	80418	the girl	381	“ Mr. Emerson , ”
80420	80445	80417	80418	the girl	381	“ do n’t leave at least , not on my account . I am going to Greece . Do n’t leave your comfortable house . ”
80460	80493	80457	80457	he	2021	“ How good everyone is ! And look at Mr. Beebe housing me — came over this morning and heard I was going ! Here I am so comfortable with a fire . ”
80494	80510	80266	80266	she	129	“ Yes , but you wo n’t go back to London . It ’s absurd . ”
80511	80560	80457	80457	he	2021	“ I must be with George ; I must make him care to live , and down here he ca n’t . He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you — I am not justifying him : I am only saying what has happened . ”
80561	80565	80569	80569	his	2022	“ Oh , Mr. Emerson”—she
80570	80623	80569	80569	his	2022	hand—“you must n’t . I ’ve been bother enough to the world by now . I ca n’t have you moving out of your house when you like it , and perhaps losing money through it — all on my account . You must stop ! I am just going to Greece . ”
80624	80631	80632	80632	Her	2023	“ All the way to Greece ? ”
80636	80640	80632	80632	Her	2023	“ To Greece ? ”
80641	80664	80457	80457	he	2021	“ So you must stop . You wo n’t talk about this business , I know . I can trust you both . ”
80665	80689	80632	80632	Her	2023	“ Certainly you can . We either have you in our lives , or leave you to the life that you have chosen . ”
80690	80696	80457	80457	he	2021	“ I should n’t want — ”
80697	80733	80632	80632	Her	2023	“ I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George ? No , it was wrong of George to try . We have pushed our beliefs too far . I fancy that we deserve sorrow . ”
80842	80858	80836	80836	he	126	“ No , please sit still . I think I will sit in the carriage . ”
80859	80868	80836	80836	he	126	“ Miss Honeychurch , you do sound tired . ”
80869	80874	80876	80876	Lucy	129	“ Not a bit , ”
80882	80906	80836	80836	he	126	“ But you are , and there ’s a look of George about you . And what were you saying about going abroad ? ”
80911	80912	80916	80916	he	126	“ Greece”—and
80921	80935	80916	80916	he	126	over—“Greece ; but you were to be married this year , I thought . ”
80936	80945	80947	80947	Lucy	129	“ Not till January , it was n’t , ”
80966	80992	80916	80916	he	126	“ I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you . I hope — it is n’t because George spoke that you are both going ? ”
80993	80996	80916	80916	he	126	“ No . ”
80997	81009	80916	80916	he	126	“ I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse . ”
81010	81014	80916	80916	he	126	“ Thank you . ”
81032	81038	81039	81039	he	133	“ That ’s all right , ”
81043	81093	81039	81039	he	133	“ I counted on you two keeping each other company . It ’s pouring again . The entire congregation , which consists of your cousin , your mother , and my mother , stands waiting in the church , till the carriage fetches it . Did Powell go round ? ”
81094	81103	80916	80916	he	126	“ I think so ; I ’ll see . ”
81104	81120	81039	81039	he	133	“ No — of course , I ’ll see . How are the Miss Alans ? ”
81121	81128	80916	80916	he	126	“ Very well , thank you . ”
81129	81138	81039	81039	he	133	“ Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece ? ”
81139	81145	80916	80916	he	126	“ I — I did . ”
81146	81190	81192	81192	he	2032	“ Do n’t you think it very plucky of her , Mr. Emerson , to undertake the two Miss Alans ? Now , Miss Honeychurch , go back — keep warm . I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling . ”
81199	81205	81206	81206	she	2034	“ He is not going , ”
81210	81224	81206	81206	she	2034	“ I made a slip . Mr. Vyse does stop behind in England . ”
81364	81378	81356	81356	he	2035	“ You are leaving him ? You are leaving the man you love ? ”
81379	81386	81344	81344	she	2034	“ I — I had to . ”
81387	81395	81356	81356	he	2035	“ Why , Miss Honeychurch , why ? ”
81448	81461	81440	81440	her	2034	“ My dear , I am worried about you . It seems to me”—dreamily
81466	81473	81440	81440	her	2034	alarmed—“that you are in a muddle . ”
81479	81634	81635	81635	She	2042	“ Take an old man ’s word ; there ’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world . It is easy to face Death and Fate , and the things that sound so dreadful . It is on my muddles that I look back with horror — on the things that I might have avoided . We can help one another but little . I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life , but I know better now , and all my teaching of George has come down to this : beware of muddle . Do you remember in that church , when you pretended to be annoyed with me and were n’t ? Do you remember before , when you refused the room with the view ? Those were muddles — little , but ominous — and I am fearing that you are in one now . ”
81639	81658	81635	81635	She	2042	“ Do n’t trust me , Miss Honeychurch . Though life is very glorious , it is difficult . ”
81664	81724	81659	81659	She	2042	“ ‘ Life ’ wrote a friend of mine , ‘ is a public performance on the violin , in which you must learn the instrument as you go along . ’ I think he puts it well . Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along — especially the function of Love . ”
81731	81746	81726	81726	he	2043	“ That ’s it ; that ’s what I mean . You love George ! ”
81766	81771	81772	81772	he	2043	“ But you do , ”
81781	81817	81772	81772	he	2043	“ You love the boy body and soul , plainly , directly , as he loves you , and no other word expresses it . You wo n’t marry the other man for his sake . ”
81818	81823	81825	81825	Lucy	129	“ How dare you ! ”
81836	81857	81825	81825	Lucy	129	“ Oh , how like a man!—I mean , to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man . ”
81858	81863	81772	81772	he	2043	“ But you are . ”
81869	82055	81772	81772	he	2043	“ You ’re shocked , but I mean to shock you . It ’s the only hope at times . I can reach you no other way . You must marry , or your life will be wasted . You have gone too far to retreat . I have no time for the tenderness , and the comradeship , and the poetry , and the things that really matter , and for which you marry . I know that , with George , you will find them , and that you love him . Then be his wife . He is already part of you . Though you fly to Greece , and never see him again , or forget his very name , George will work in your thoughts till you die . It is n’t possible to love and to part . You will wish that it was . You can transmute love , ignore it , muddle it , but you can never pull it out of you . I know by experience that the poets are right : love is eternal . ”
82075	82198	82200	82200	he	2045	“ I only wish poets would say this , too : love is of the body ; not the body , but of the body . Ah ! the misery that would be saved if we confessed that ! Ah ! for a little directness to liberate the soul ! Your soul , dear Lucy ! I hate the word now , because of all the ca nt with which superstition has wrapped it round . But we have souls . I can not say how they came nor whither they go , but we have them , and I see you ruining yours . I can not bear it . It is again the darkness creeping in ; it is hell . ”
82204	82266	82200	82200	he	2045	“ What nonsense I have talked — how abstract and remote ! And I have made you cry ! Dear girl , forgive my prosiness ; marry my boy . When I think what life is , and how seldom love is answered by love — Marry him ; it is one of the moments for which the world was made . ”
82302	82307	82293	82293	she	2046	“ Then , Lucy — ”
82308	82314	82315	82315	she	2046	“ You ’ve frightened me , ”
82318	82331	82315	82315	she	2046	“ Cecil — Mr. Beebe — the ticket ’s bought — everything . ”
82339	82373	82332	82332	She	2046	“ I ’m caught in the tangle . I must suffer and grow old away from him . I can not break the whole of life for his sake . They trusted me . ”
82384	82399	82401	82401	she	2046	“ Give George my love — once only . Tell him ‘ muddle . ’ ”
82415	82418	82401	82401	she	2046	“ Lucy — ”
82419	82440	82401	82401	she	2046	“ No — they are in the hall — oh , please not , Mr. Emerson — they trust me — ”
82441	82453	82401	82401	she	2046	“ But why should they , when you have deceived them ? ”
82462	82468	82454	82455	Mr. Beebe	133	“ Here ’s my mother . ”
82469	82478	82401	82401	she	2046	“ You ’re not worthy of their trust . ”
82479	82484	82486	82487	Mr. Beebe	133	“ What ’s that ? ”
82490	82505	82401	82401	she	2046	“ I was saying , why should you trust her when she deceived you ? ”
82506	82512	82513	82513	He	133	“ One minute , mother . ”
82521	82540	82401	82401	she	2046	“ I do n’t follow you , Mr. Emerson . To whom do you refer ? Trust whom ? ”
82541	82564	82401	82401	she	2046	“ I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George . They have loved one another all along . ”
82604	82611	82613	82613	Lucy	129	“ I shall never marry him , ”
82627	82631	82624	82624	he	133	“ Why not ? ”
82632	82646	82624	82624	he	133	“ Mr. Beebe — I have misled you — I have misled myself — ”
82647	82655	82624	82624	he	133	“ Oh , rubbish , Miss Honeychurch ! ”
82656	82662	82664	82666	the old man	360	“ It is not rubbish ! ”
82669	82682	82664	82666	the old man	360	“ It ’s the part of people that you do n’t understand . ”
82696	82701	82624	82624	he	133	“ Lucy ! Lucy ! ”
82708	82717	82718	82718	He	133	“ Mr. Beebe , could you help me ? ”
82734	82753	82718	82718	He	133	“ I am more grieved than I can possibly express . It is lamentable , lamentable — incredible . ”
82754	82762	82765	82766	the other	2602	“ What ’s wrong with the boy ? ”
82769	82794	82795	82795	He	133	“ Nothing , Mr. Emerson , except that he no longer interests me . Marry George , Miss Honeychurch . He will do admirably . ”
82812	82815	82802	82802	They	2053	“ Lucy ! ”
82844	82964	82966	82966	his	2056	“ Now it is all dark . Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed . I know . But remember the mountains over Florence and the view . Ah , dear , if I were George , and gave you one kiss , it would make you brave . You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth , out into the muddle that you have made yourself ; and your mother and all your friends will despise you , oh , my darling , and rightly , if it is ever right to despise . George still dark , all the tussle and the misery without a word from him . Am I justified ? ”
82972	82996	82966	82966	his	2056	“ Yes , for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure ; there is Truth . Truth counts , Truth does count . ”
82997	83002	83004	83005	the girl	381	“ You kiss me , ”
83007	83016	83004	83005	the girl	381	“ You kiss me . I will try . ”
83091	83096	83097	83097	she	381	“ never exactly understood , ”
83104	83128	83097	83097	she	381	“ how he managed to strengthen her . It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once . ”
83270	83277	83279	83279	Lucy	129	“ No , it is n’t , ”
83281	83310	83279	83279	Lucy	129	“ because it is the room I had , and I had your father ’s room . I forget why ; Charlotte made me , for some reason . ”
83326	83335	83311	83311	He	126	“ George , you baby , get up . ”
83336	83345	83347	83347	George	126	“ Why should n’t I be a baby ? ”
83383	83389	83390	83390	she	129	“ Oh , bother Charlotte , ”
83394	83403	83390	83390	she	129	“ What can such people be made of ? ”
83404	83413	83355	83355	she	129	“ Same stuff as parsons are made of . ”
83414	83417	83390	83390	she	129	“ Nonsense ! ”
83418	83426	83355	83355	she	129	“ Quite right . It is nonsense . ”
83427	83454	83390	83390	she	129	“ Now you get up off the cold floor , or you ’ll be starting rheumatism next , and you stop laughing and being so silly . ”
83455	83462	83463	83463	he	126	“ Why should n’t I laugh ? ”
83479	83491	83492	83492	He	126	“ What ’s there to cry at ? Kiss me here . ”
83558	83562	83563	83563	he	126	“ Any letters ? ”
83566	83573	83591	83591	he	126	“ Just a line from Freddy . ”
83574	83583	83591	83591	he	126	“ Now kiss me here ; then here . ”
83735	83758	83788	83788	George	126	“ Lucy , you come and look at the cypresses ; and the church , whatever its name is , still shows . ”
83759	83770	83788	83788	George	126	“ San Miniato . I ’ll just finish your sock . ”
83771	83779	83781	83782	the cabman	2086	“ Signorino , domani faremo uno giro , ”
83846	83854	83878	83878	they	2087	“ Anything good in Freddy ’s letter ? ”
83855	83859	83860	83860	His	126	“ Not yet . ”
83896	83902	83878	83878	they	2087	“ What does he say ? ”
83903	83966	83878	83878	they	2087	“ Silly boy ! He thinks he ’s being dignified . He knew we should go off in the spring — he has known it for six months — that if mother would n’t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands . They had fair warning , and now he calls it an elopement . Ridiculous boy — ”
83967	83975	83878	83878	they	2087	“ Signorino , domani faremo uno giro — ”
83976	84049	83878	83878	they	2087	“ But it will all come right in the end . He has to build us both up from the beginning again . I wish , though , that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women . He has , for the second time , quite altered . Why will men have theories about women ? I have n’t any about men . I wish , too , that Mr. Beebe — ”
84050	84057	83878	83878	they	2087	“ You may well wish that . ”
84058	84121	83878	83878	they	2087	“ He will never forgive us — I mean , he will never be interested in us again . I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner . I wish he hadn’t — But if we act the truth , the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run . ”
84122	84125	84127	84127	he	2090	“ Perhaps . ”
84132	84159	84127	84127	he	2090	“ Well , I acted the truth — the only thing I did do — and you came back to me . So possibly you know . ”
84167	84173	84174	84174	He	2090	“ Nonsense with that sock . ”
84247	84253	84243	84243	They	2093	“ Signorino , domani faremo — ”
84254	84261	84263	84263	Lucy	129	“ Oh , bother that man ! ”
84272	84282	84263	84263	Lucy	129	“ No , do n’t be rude to him . ”
84294	84315	84291	84291	she	129	“ Mr. Eager and Charlotte , dreadful frozen Charlotte . How cruel she would be to a man like that ! ”
84316	84326	84243	84243	They	2093	“ Look at the lights going over the bridge . ”
84327	84401	84291	84291	she	129	“ But this room reminds me of Charlotte . How horrible to grow old in Charlotte ’s way ! To think that evening at the rectory that she should n’t have heard your father was in the house . For she would have stopped me going in , and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense . You could n’t have made me . When I am very happy”—she
84403	84441	84243	84243	They	2093	him—“I remember on how little it all hangs . If Charlotte had only known , she would have stopped me going in , and I should have gone to silly Greece , and become different for ever . ”
84442	84448	84450	84450	George	126	“ But she did know , ”
84452	84465	84450	84450	George	126	“ she did see my father , surely . He said so . ”
84466	84502	84243	84243	They	2093	“ Oh , no , she did n’t see him . She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe , do n’t you remember , and then went straight to the church . She said so . ”
84508	84512	84514	84514	he	126	“ My father , ”

84635	84665	84626	84626	George	126	“ It ’s clear that she knew . Then , why did she risk the meeting ? She knew he was there , and yet she went to church . ”
84694	84711	84687	84687	She	129	“ How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment . ”
84744	84751	84741	84741	George	126	“ Or did she mean it ? ”

84832	85049	84829	84829	He	126	“ Is it this ? Is this possible ? I ’ll put a marvel to you . That your cousin has always hoped . That from the very first moment we met , she hoped , far down in her mind , that we should be like this — of course , very far down . That she fought us on the surface , and yet she hoped . I ca n’t explain her any other way . Can you ? Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer ; how she gave you no peace ; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable . The sight of us haunted her — or she could n’t have described us as she did to her friend . There are details — it burnt . I read the book afterwards . She is not frozen , Lucy , she is not withered up all through . She tore us apart twice , but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy . We can never make friends with her or thank her . But I do believe that , far down in her heart , far below all speech and behaviour , she is glad . ”
