6868	7230	6865	6866	John Foster	114	“ that to know them one must live with them . An occasional saunter through them , keeping to the well - trodden paths , will never admit us to their intimacy . If we wish to be friends we must seek them out and win them by frequent , reverent visits at all hours ; by morning , by noon , and by night ; and at all seasons , in spring , in summer , in autumn , in winter . Otherwise we can never really know them and any pretence we may make to the contrary will never impose on them . They have their own effective way of keeping aliens at a distance and shutting their hearts to mere casual sightseers . It is of no use to seek the woods from any motive except sheer love of them ; they will find us out at once and hide all their sweet , old - world secrets from us . But if they know we come to them because we love them they will be very kind to us and give us such treasures of beauty and delight as are not bought or sold in any market - place . For the woods , when they give at all , give unstintedly and hold nothing back from their true worshippers . We must go to them lovingly , humbly , patiently , watchfully , and we shall learn what poignant loveliness lurks in the wild places and silent intervals , lying under starshine and sunset , what cadences of unearthly music are harped on aged pine boughs or crooned in copses of fir , what delicate savours exhale from mosses and ferns in sunny corners or on damp brooklands , what dreams and myths and legends of an older time haunt them . Then the immortal heart of the woods will beat against ours and its subtle life will steal into our veins and make us its own forever , so that no matter where we go or how widely we wander we shall yet be drawn back to the forest to find our most enduring kinship . ”

7432	7475	7486	7486	Valancy	107	“ You are mistaken . It can not possibly have been more than two weeks . I dislike contradiction . And I do not see what you want to get a book for , anyhow . You waste too much time reading . ”
7476	7484	7486	7486	Valancy	107	“ Of what value is my time ? ”

7663	7681	7575	7576	Christine Stickles	121	“ Mother , I do n’t need a flannel petticoat . My sateen one is warm enough . ”

There ’s nothing like Redfern ’s Bitters for building a body up . Cousin James says the Purple Pills are the best , but I know better . My poor dear husband took Redfern ’s Bitters right up to the day he died . Do n’t let them charge you more’n ninety cents . I kin git it for that at the Port . And what have you been saying to your poor mother ? Do you ever stop to think , Doss , that you kin only have one mother ? ”

24399	24410	24396	24397	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ I noticed it the first time I saw him . ”
24411	24433	24438	24438	He	108	“ ‘ A fellow by the hand of nature marked , Quoted and signed to do a deed of shame ’ , ”
24463	24478	24480	24480	Valancy	107	“ One of his eyebrows is an arch and the other is a triangle , ”
24482	24492	24480	24480	Valancy	107	“ Is that why you think him so villainous ? ”
24520	24532	24534	24534	Olive	175	“ How do you know his eyebrows so well , Doss ? ”
24558	24563	24565	24566	Aunt Wellington	91	“ Yes , how ? ”
24568	24581	24583	24583	Valancy	107	“ I ’ve seen him twice and I looked at him closely , ”
24586	24599	24583	24583	Valancy	107	“ I thought his face the most interesting one I ever saw . ”
24600	24616	24618	24618	Olive	175	“ There is no doubt there is something fishy in the creature ’s past life , ”
24640	24657	24624	24624	she	175	“ But he can hardly be guilty of everything he ’s accused of , you know . ”
24703	24719	24721	24724	Second Cousin Sarah Taylor	167	“ They say he keeps dozens of cats in that hut up back on Mistawis , ”
24759	24770	24772	24773	Aunt Isabel	109	“ That alone shows there is something wrong with him , ”
24775	24783	24785	24785	Valancy	107	“ People who do n’t like cats , ”
24794	24810	24785	24785	Valancy	107	“ always seem to think that there is some peculiar virtue in not liking them . ”
24811	24822	24824	24825	Uncle Wellington	95	“ The man has n’t a friend except Roaring Abel , ”
24827	24857	24824	24825	Uncle Wellington	95	“ And if Roaring Abel had kept away from him , as everybody else did , it would have been better for — for some members of his family . ”
24890	24895	24897	24897	Valancy	107	“ If you mean , ”
24900	24923	24897	24897	Valancy	107	“ that Barney Snaith is the father of Cecily Gay ’s child , he is n’t . It ’s a wicked lie . ”
25025	25030	25032	25033	Cousin Stickles	97	“ Hush — hush ! ”
25035	25043	25045	25045	Valancy	107	“ I do n’t mean to hush , ”
25048	25081	25045	25045	Valancy	107	“ I ’ve hush — hushed all my life . I ’ll scream if I want to . Do n’t make me want to . And stop talking nonsense about Barney Snaith . ”
25248	25266	25268	25269	Aunt Wellington	91	“ When I was a young girl I never thought or spoke about such matters , Doss , ”
25273	25282	25284	25284	Valancy	107	“ But I ’m not a young girl , ”
25288	25394	25284	25284	Valancy	107	“ Are n’t you always rubbing that into me ? And you are all evil - minded , senseless gossips . Ca n’t you leave poor Cissy Gay alone ? She ’s dying . Whatever she did , God or the Devil has punished her enough for it . You need n’t take a hand , too . As for Barney Snaith , the only crime he has been guilty of is living to himself and minding his own business . He can , it seems , get along without you . Which is an unpardonable sin , of course , in your little snobocracy . ”
25426	25444	25446	25447	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Valancy , your poor father would turn over in his grave if he could hear you , ”
25449	25461	25463	25463	Valancy	107	“ I dare say he would like that for a change , ”
25466	25469	25471	25472	Uncle James	107	“ Doss , ”
25475	25495	25471	25472	Uncle James	107	“ the Ten Commandments are fairly up to date still — especially the fifth . Have you forgotten that ? ”
25496	25499	25501	25501	Valancy	107	“ No , ”
25503	25544	25501	25501	Valancy	107	“ but I thought you had — especially the ninth . Have you ever thought , Uncle James , how dull life would be without the Ten Commandments ? It is only when things are forbidden that they become fascinating . ”
25587	25627	25581	25581	She	107	“ I am going home now . I only came for the dinner . It was very good , Aunt Alberta , although your salad - dressing is not salt enough and a dash of cayenne would improve it . ”
25654	25667	25669	25670	Cousin Stickles	97	“ She ’s feverish — I’ve said right along she was feverish , ”
25685	25698	25699	25699	he	108	“ She ’s dippy — I tell you she ’s gone dippy , ”
25703	25715	25699	25699	he	108	“ That ’s all there is about it . Clean dippy . ”
25716	25721	25723	25724	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ Oh , Benjamin , ”
25727	25750	25723	25724	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ do n’t condemn her too rashly . We must remember what dear old Shakespeare says — that charity thinketh no evil . ”
25751	25758	25760	25761	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Charity ! Poppy - cock ! ”
25763	25835	25760	25761	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ I never heard a young woman talk such stuff in my life as she just did . Talking about things she ought to be ashamed to think of , much less mention . Blaspheming ! Insulting us ! What she wants is a generous dose of spank - weed and I ’d like to be the one to administer it . H - uh - h - h - h ! ”
25849	25864	25866	25867	Cousin Stickles	97	“ Do you suppose that the mumps could work on a person that way ? ”
25869	25879	25881	25882	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ I opened an umbrella in the house yesterday , ”
25884	25892	25881	25882	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ I knew it betokened some misfortune . ”
25893	25906	25908	25909	Cousin Mildred	188	“ Have you tried to find out if she has a temperature ? ”
25911	25924	25926	25927	Cousin Stickles	97	“ She would n’t let Amelia put the thermometer under her tongue , ”
25942	25948	25949	25949	she	99	“ I must tell you , ”
25952	26006	25949	25949	she	99	“ that Valancy has been acting very strangely for over two weeks now . She has n’t been a bit like herself — Christine could tell you . I have hoped against hope that it was only one of her colds coming on . But it is — it must be something worse . ”
26007	26016	26018	26019	Cousin Gladys	92	“ This is bringing on my neuritis again , ”
26028	26035	26037	26037	Herbert	105	“ Do n’t cry , Amelia , ”
26050	26054	26048	26048	He	105	“ family ructions . ”
26077	26111	26071	26071	she	99	“ You ’ll have to take her to a doctor . This may be only a — er — a brainstorm . There are such things as brainstorms nowadays , are n’t there ? ”
26112	26124	26126	26127	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ I — I suggested consulting a doctor to her yesterday , ”
26129	26152	26126	26127	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ And she said she would n’t go to a doctor — wouldn’t . Oh , surely I have had trouble enough ! ”
26153	26163	26165	26166	Cousin Stickles	97	“ And she wo n’t take Redfern ’s Bitters , ”
26168	26172	26174	26175	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Or anything , ”
26177	26189	26191	26192	Cousin Stickles	97	“ And she ’s determined to go to the Presbyterian church , ”
26211	26218	26220	26221	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ That proves she ’s dippy , ”
26223	26243	26220	26221	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ I noticed something strange about her the minute she came in today . I noticed it before today . ”
26250	26262	26220	26221	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ m - i - r - a - z - h. ”
26264	26312	26220	26221	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Everything she said today showed an unbalanced mind . That question—‘Was it a vital part ? ’ Was there any sense at all in that remark ? None whatever ! There never was anything like that in the Stirlings . It must be from the Wansbarras . ”
26323	26335	26336	26336	she	99	“ I never heard of anything like that in the Wansbarras , ”
26339	26346	26348	26349	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Your father was odd enough , ”
26351	26358	26360	26361	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Poor Pa was — peculiar , ”
26364	26372	26360	26361	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ but his mind was never affected . ”
26373	26385	26387	26388	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ He talked all his life exactly as Valancy did today , ”
26390	26491	26387	26388	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ And he believed he was his own great - great grandfather born over again . I ’ve heard him say it . Do n’t tell me that a man who believed a thing like that was ever in his right senses . Come , come , Amelia , stop sniffling . Of course Doss has made a terrible exhibition of herself today , but she ’s not responsible . Old maids are apt to fly off at a tangent like that . If she had been married when she should have been she would n’t have got like this . ”
26492	26499	26501	26502	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Nobody wanted to marry her , ”
26516	26526	26528	26529	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Well , fortunately there ’s no outsider here , ”
26531	26571	26528	26529	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ We may keep it in the family yet . I ’ll take her over to see Dr. Marsh tomorrow . I know how to deal with pig - headed people . Wo n’t that be best , James ? ”
26572	26580	26582	26583	Uncle James	107	“ We must have medical advice certainly , ”
26585	26628	26582	26583	Uncle James	107	“ Well , that ’s settled . In the meantime , Amelia , act as if nothing had happened and keep an eye on her . Do n’t let her be alone . Above all , do n’t let her sleep alone . ”
26635	26765	26528	26529	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ I ca n’t help it . Night before last I suggested she ’d better have Christine sleep with her . She positively refused — and locked her door . Oh , you do n’t know how she ’s changed . She wo n’t work . At least , she wo n’t sew . She does her usual housework , of course . But she would n’t sweep the parlour yesterday morning , though we always sweep it on Thursdays . She said she ’d wait till it was dirty . ‘ Would you rather sweep a dirty room than a clean one ? ’ I asked her . She said , ‘ Of course . I ’d see something for my labour then . ’ Think of it ! ”
26772	26776	26766	26767	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ The jar of potpourri”—Cousin
26781	26806	26766	26767	Uncle Benjamin	108	spelled—“has disappeared from her room . I found the pieces in the next lot . She wo n’t tell us what happened to it . ”
26807	26817	26819	26820	Uncle Herbert	105	“ I should never have dreamed it of Doss , ”
26822	26841	26819	26820	Uncle Herbert	105	“ She has always seemed such a quiet , sensible girl . A bit backward — but sensible . ”
26842	26859	26861	26862	Uncle James	107	“ The only thing you can be sure of in this world is the multiplication table , ”
26869	26877	26879	26880	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Well , let ’s cheer up , ”
26882	26892	26879	26880	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Why are chorus girls like fine stock raisers ? ”
26893	26896	26898	26899	Cousin Stickles	97	“ Why ? ”
26916	26922	26924	26925	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Like to exhibit calves , ”
27082	27100	27076	27077	some one	359	“ Yes , I know . It ’s dreadful — be brave — you’ll soon be better ; ”
27566	27570	27571	27571	she	107	“ I wish , ”
27575	27589	27571	27571	she	107	“ that I may have one little dust - pile before I die . ”
27624	27698	27618	27618	Valancy	107	“ Why on earth should I go to Dr. Marsh ? There ’s nothing the matter with my mind . Though you all think I ’ve suddenly gone crazy . Well , I have n’t . I ’ve simply grown tired of living to please other people and have decided to please myself . It will give you something to talk about besides my stealing the raspberry jam . So that ’s that . ”
27699	27702	27704	27705	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Doss , ”
27711	27719	27704	27705	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ you are not — like yourself . ”
27720	27728	27730	27730	Valancy	107	“ Who am I like , then ? ”
27738	27743	27744	27744	he	108	“ Your Grandfather Wansbarra , ”
27748	27751	27752	27752	Valancy	107	“ Thanks . ”
27756	27843	27752	27752	Valancy	107	“ That ’s a real compliment . I remember Grandfather Wansbarra . He was one of the few human beings I have known — almost the only one . Now , it is of no use to scold or entreat or command , Uncle Benjamin — or exchange anguished glances with Mother and Cousin Stickles . I am not going to any doctor . And if you bring any doctor here I wo n’t see him . So what are you going to do about it ? ”
27886	27893	27895	27895	Valancy	107	“ Do n’t worry , Mother , ”
27902	27923	27895	27895	Valancy	107	“ It is n’t likely I ’ll do anything very terrible . But I mean to have a little fun . ”
27924	27927	27928	27929	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Fun ! ”
28017	28028	28003	28003	Valancy	107	“ I do n’t show my gums when I laugh . ”
28029	28114	28003	28003	Valancy	107	“ More as if she were talking to herself than to me . Indeed , Mother , all the time I was talking to her she gave me the impression of not really listening . And that was n’t all . When I finally decided that what I was saying had no influence over her I begged her , when Cecil came next week , not to say anything queer before him , at least . Mother , what do you think she said ? ”
28115	28124	28126	28127	Aunt Wellington	91	“ I ’m sure I ca n’t imagine , ”
28133	28169	28003	28003	Valancy	107	“ She said , ‘ I ’d rather like to shock Cecil . His mouth is too red for a man ’s . ’ Mother , I can never feel the same to Valancy again . ”
28170	28178	28180	28181	Aunt Wellington	91	“ Her mind is affected , Olive , ”
28184	28196	28180	28181	Aunt Wellington	91	“ You must not hold her responsible for what she says . ”
28217	28234	28236	28236	Valancy	107	“ You made me apologise to Olive fifteen years ago for something I did n’t do , ”
28238	28247	28236	28236	Valancy	107	“ That old apology will do for now . ”
28274	28281	28248	28250	Another solemn family	1001	“ ever since poor Doss went queer ”
28318	28322	28324	28325	Uncle Benjamin	108	while—“give her her head ”
28327	28340	28324	28325	Uncle Benjamin	108	it—“keep a careful eye on her but let her pretty much alone . ”
28344	28347	28378	28379	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ watchful waiting ”
28368	28376	28378	28379	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ We must be guided by developments , ”
28381	28383	28378	28379	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ It is”—solemnly—“easier
28400	28400	28395	28395	she	107	”
29335	29338	29332	29332	Valancy	107	“ Cissy Gay ”
29570	29573	29566	29566	he	141	“ dead drunk ”
29608	29623	29625	29626	Mr. Bently	196	“ Have you never done anything in your life that you are sorry for ? ”
29640	29645	29646	29646	he	141	“ Well , yes , ”
29650	29671	29646	29646	he	141	“ There were some women I might have kissed and did n’t . I ’ve always been sorry for that . ”
29934	29939	29940	29940	She	182	“ with a fellow . ”
29942	29947	29948	29948	they	1063	“ kept herself to herself ”
29954	29965	29948	29948	they	1063	“ Too good for our dances . And now look ! ”
30111	30113	30127	30127	he	141	“ do ”
30130	30132	30127	30127	he	141	“ hypocrites ”
30236	30260	30565	30565	Valancy	107	“ Do you mean to say that Cissy is all alone there now , with nobody to do anything for her — nobody ? ”
30261	30326	30327	30327	Abel	141	“ Oh , she can move about a bit and get a bite and sup when she wants it . But she ca n’t work . It ’s d —— d hard for a man to work hard all day and go home at night tired and hungry and cook his own meals . Sometimes I ’m sorry I kicked old Rachel Edwards out . ”
30332	30550	30565	30565	Valancy	107	“ Her face looked as if it had wore out a hundred bodies . And she moped . Talk about temper ! Temper ’s nothing to moping . She was too slow to catch worms , and dirty — d —— d dirty . I ai n’t unreasonable — I know a man has to eat his peck before he dies — but she went over the limit . What d’ye sp’ose I saw that lady do ? She ’d made some punkin jam — had it on the table in glass jars with the tops off . The dawg got up on the table and stuck his paw into one of them . What did she do ? She jest took holt of the dawg and wrung the syrup off his paw back into the jar ! Then screwed the top on and set it in the pantry . I sets open the door and says to her , ‘ Go ! ’ The dame went , and I fired the jars of punkin after her , two at a time . Thought I ’d die laughing to see old Rachel run — with them punkin jars raining after her . She ’s told everywhere I ’m crazy , so nobody’ll come for love or money . ”
30551	30563	30565	30565	Valancy	107	“ But Cissy must have some one to look after her , ”
30604	30689	30565	30565	Valancy	107	“ Oh , she gits on . Barney Snaith always drops in when he ’s passing and does anything she wants done . Brings her oranges and flowers and things . There ’s a Christian for you . Yet that sanctimonious , snivelling parcel of St. Andrew ’s people would n’t be seen on the same side of the road with him . Their dogs’ll go to heaven before they do . And their minister — slick as if the cat had licked him ! ”
30690	30720	30722	30722	Valancy	107	“ There are plenty of good people , both in St. Andrew ’s and St. George ’s , who would be kind to Cissy if you would behave yourself , ”
30725	30735	30722	30722	Valancy	107	“ They ’re afraid to go near your place . ”
30736	30844	30565	30565	Valancy	107	“ Because I ’m such a sad old dog ? But I do n’t bite — never bit any one in my life . A few loose words spilled around do n’t hurt any one . And I ’m not asking people to come . Do n’t want ’em poking and prying about . What I want is a housekeeper . If I shaved every Sunday and went to church I ’d get all the housekeepers I ’d want . I ’d be respectable then . But what ’s the use of going to church when it ’s all settled by predestination ? Tell me that , Miss. ”
30845	30849	30851	30851	Valancy	107	“ Is it ? ”
30853	30889	30565	30565	Valancy	107	“ Yes . Ca n’t git around it nohow . Wish I could . I do n’t want either heaven or hell for steady . Wish a man could have ’em mixed in equal proportions . ”
30890	30902	30904	30904	Valancy	107	“ Is n’t that the way it is in this world ? ”
30921	30926	30928	30928	Abel	141	“ No , no , ”
30939	30987	30928	30928	Abel	141	“ There ’s too much hell here — entirely too much hell . That ’s why I get drunk so often . It sets you free for a little while — free from yourself — yes , by God , free from predestination . Ever try it ? ”
30988	30999	31001	31001	Valancy	107	“ No , I ’ve another way of getting free , ”
31004	31021	31001	31001	Valancy	107	“ But about Cissy now . She must have some one to look after her — — ”
31022	31062	30928	30928	Abel	141	“ What are you harping on Sis for ? Seems to me you ai n’t bothered much about her up to now . You never even come to see her . And she used to like you so well . ”
31063	31068	31070	31070	Valancy	107	“ I should have , ”
31072	31092	31070	31070	Valancy	107	“ But never mind . You could n’t understand . The point is — you must have a housekeeper . ”
31093	31121	30928	30928	Abel	141	“ Where am I to get one ? I can pay decent wages if I could get a decent woman . D’ye think I like old hags ? ”
31122	31127	31129	31129	Valancy	107	“ Will I do ? ”
31133	31139	31141	31142	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Let us be calm , ”
31144	31151	31141	31142	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Let us be perfectly calm . ”
31152	31155	31156	31157	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Calm ! ”
31162	31181	31156	31157	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ How can I be calm — how could anybody be calm under such a disgrace as this ? ”
31182	31193	31195	31196	Uncle James	107	“ Why in the world did you let her go ? ”
31198	31287	31141	31142	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Let her ! How could I stop her , James ? It seems she packed the big valise and sent it away with Roaring Abel when he went home after supper , while Christine and I were out in the kitchen . Then Doss herself came down with her little satchel , dressed in her green serge suit . I felt a terrible premonition . I ca n’t tell you how it was , but I seemed to know that Doss was going to do something dreadful . ”
31288	31304	31306	31307	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ It ’s a pity you could n’t have had your premonition a little sooner , ”
31310	31339	31141	31142	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ I said , ‘ Doss , where are you going ? ’ and she said , ‘ I am going to look for my Blue Castle . ’ ”
31340	31355	31357	31358	Uncle James	107	“ Would n’t you think that would convince Marsh that her mind is affected ? ”
31360	31413	31141	31142	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ And I said , ‘ Valancy , what do you mean ? ’ And she said , ‘ I am going to keep house for Roaring Abel and nurse Cissy . He will pay me thirty dollars a month . ’ I wonder I did n’t drop dead on the spot . ”
31414	31434	31436	31437	Uncle James	107	“ You should n’t have let her go — you should n’t have let her out of the house , ”
31439	31450	31436	31437	Uncle James	107	“ You should have locked the door — anything — — ”
31451	31624	31141	31142	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ She was between me and the front door . And you ca n’t realise how determined she was . She was like a rock . That ’s the strangest thing of all about her . She used to be so good and obedient , and now she ’s neither to hold nor bind . But I said everything I could think of to bring her to her senses . I asked her if she had no regard for her reputation . I said to her solemnly , ‘ Doss , when a woman ’s reputation is once smirched nothing can ever make it spotless again . Your character will be gone for ever if you go to Roaring Abel ’s to wait on a bad girl like Sis Gay . ’ And she said , ‘ I do n’t believe Cissy was a bad girl , but I do n’t care if she was . ’ Those were her very words , ‘ I do n’t care if she was . ’ ”
31625	31634	31636	31637	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ She has lost all sense of decency , ”
31639	31689	31141	31142	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ ‘ Cissy Gay is dying , ’ she said , ‘ and it ’s a shame and disgrace that she is dying in a Christian community with no one to do anything for her . Whatever she ’s been or done , she ’s a human being . ’ ”
31690	31707	31709	31710	Uncle James	107	“ Well , you know , when it comes to that , I suppose she is , ”
31721	31764	31141	31142	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ I asked Doss if she had no regard for appearances . She said , ‘ I ’ve been keeping up appearances all my life . Now I ’m going in for realities . Appearances can go hang ! ’ Go hang ! ”
31765	31770	31772	31773	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ An outrageous thing ! ”
31776	31781	31772	31773	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ An outrageous thing ! ”
31811	31884	31885	31886	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ I told her — we both told her — that Roaring Abel had certainly killed his wife in one of his drunken rages and would kill her . She laughed and said , ‘ I ’m not afraid of Roaring Abel . He wo n’t kill me , and he ’s too old for me to be afraid of his gallantries . ’ What did she mean ? What are gallantries ? ”
31903	31950	31885	31886	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ I said to her , ‘ Valancy , if you have no regard for your own reputation and your family ’s standing , have you none for my feelings ? ’ She said , ‘ None . ’ Just like that , ‘ None ! ’ ”
31951	31965	31967	31968	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Insane people never do have any regard for other people ’s feelings , ”
31970	31978	31967	31968	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ That ’s one of the symptoms . ”
31979	32052	31885	31886	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ I broke out into tears then , and she said , ‘ Come now , Mother , be a good sport . I ’m going to do an act of Christian charity , and as for the damage it will do my reputation , why , you know I have n’t any matrimonial chances anyhow , so what does it matter ? ’ And with that she turned and went out . ”
32053	32062	32064	32065	Cousin Stickles	97	“ The last words I said to her , ”
32068	32098	32064	32065	Cousin Stickles	97	“ were , ‘ Who will rub my back at nights now ? ’ And she said — she said — but no , I can not repeat it . ”
32099	32102	32104	32105	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Nonsense , ”
32107	32120	32104	32105	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Out with it . This is no time to be squeamish . ”
32121	32123	32124	32124	Stickles	97	“ She said”—Cousin
32132	32138	32124	32124	Stickles	97	whisper—“she said—‘Oh , darn ! ’ ”
32139	32152	32154	32155	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ To think I should have lived to hear my daughter swearing ! ”
32157	32166	32168	32169	Cousin Stickles	97	“ It — it was only imitation swearing , ”
32192	32205	32207	32208	Uncle James	107	“ It will be only a step from that to real swearing , ”
32211	32215	32217	32217	Frederick	99	“ The worst of this”—Mrs
32225	32255	32217	32217	Frederick	99	handkerchief—“is that every one will know now that she is deranged . We ca n’t keep it a secret any longer . Oh , I can not bear it ! ”
32256	32269	32271	32272	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ You should have been stricter with her when she was young , ”
32274	32285	32287	32288	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ I do n’t see how I could have been , ”
32293	32312	32314	32315	Uncle James	107	“ The worst feature of the case is that Snaith scoundrel is always hanging around Roaring Abel ’s , ”
32317	32347	32314	32315	Uncle James	107	“ I shall be thankful if nothing worse comes of this mad freak than a few weeks at Roaring Abel ’s . Cissy Gay ca n’t live much longer . ”
32348	32359	32361	32362	Cousin Stickles	97	“ And she did n’t even take her flannel petticoat ! ”
32364	32374	32376	32377	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ I ’ll see Ambrose Marsh again about this , ”
32387	32394	32396	32397	Uncle James	107	“ I ’ll see Lawyer Ferguson , ”
32399	32402	32404	32405	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Meanwhile , ”
32407	32413	32404	32405	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ let us be calm . ”
32626	32630	32578	32578	She	107	“ up back , ”
32690	32695	32724	32724	Abel	141	gate—“A. Gay , Carpenter , ”
32875	32881	32882	32882	he	141	“ So you ’ve come , ”
32886	32898	32882	32882	he	141	“ I never s’posed that ruck of Stirlings would let you . ”
32909	32916	32902	32902	her	107	“ They could n’t stop me . ”
32917	32928	32930	32931	Roaring Abel	141	“ I did n’t think you ’d so much spunk , ”
32934	32944	32945	32945	he	141	“ And look at the nice ankles of her , ”
33214	33242	33202	33202	She	107	“ Cissy dear , I ’ve come to look after you . I ’ll stay with you till — till — as long as you want me . ”
33243	33246	33247	33247	Cissy	182	“ Oh ! ”
33257	33313	33249	33249	her	182	“ Oh — will you ? It ’s been so — lonely . I can wait on myself — but it ’s been so lonely . It — would just be like — heaven — to have some one here — like you . You were always — so sweet to me — long ago . ”
33356	33370	33372	33373	Roaring Abel	141	“ Most things are predestinated , but some are just darn sheer luck , ”
33657	33723	33654	33655	John Foster	114	“ It is a pity to gather wood - flowers . They lose half their witchery away from the green and the flicker . The way to enjoy wood - flowers is to track them down to their remote haunts — gloat over them — and then leave them with backward glances , taking with us only the beguiling memory of their grace and fragrance . ”
33851	33860	33861	33861	he	141	“ Folks should always sing at their work , ”
33864	33870	33861	33861	he	141	“ Sounds cheerful - like . ”
33871	33875	33877	33877	Valancy	107	“ Not always , ”
33879	33892	33877	33877	Valancy	107	“ Fancy a butcher singing at his work . Or an undertaker . ”
33901	33941	33896	33896	his	141	“ There ’s no getting the better of you . You ’ve got an answer every time . I should think the Stirlings would be glad to be rid of you . They do n’t like being sassed back . ”
34000	34012	33991	33991	Cissy	182	“ Father never does anything — he just makes a noise . ”
34129	34140	34123	34124	Once Valancy	107	“ What is the use of getting in a rage ? ”
34141	34151	34153	34153	Abel	141	“ It ’s such a d —— d relief , ”
34162	34170	34172	34172	Abel	141	“ You ’re a great little sport , ”
34175	34232	34172	34172	Abel	141	“ Do n’t mind my bad French . I do n’t mean a thing by it . Jest habit . Say , I like a woman that ai n’t afraid to speak up to me . Sis there was always too meek — too meek . That ’s why she got adrift . I like you . ”
34233	34238	34240	34240	Valancy	107	“ All the same , ”
34243	34292	34240	34240	Valancy	107	“ there is no use in sending things to hell as you ’re always doing . And I ’m not going to have you tracking mud all over a floor I ’ve just scrubbed . You must use the scraper whether you consign it to perdition or not . ”
34451	34553	34448	34448	her	182	“ No , I ca n’t get well . My lungs are almost gone . And I — don’t want to . I ’m so tired , Valancy . Only dying can rest me . But it ’s lovely to have you here — you’ll never know how much it means to me . But Valancy — you work too hard . You do n’t need to — Father only wants his meals cooked . I do n’t think you are strong yourself . You turn so pale sometimes . And those drops you take . Are you well , dear ? ”
34554	34560	34562	34562	Valancy	107	“ I ’m all right , ”
34572	34598	34565	34565	She	107	“ And I ’m not working hard . I ’m glad to have some work to do — something that really wants to be done . ”
34599	34600	34602	34602	her	107	“ Then”—Cissy
34606	34711	34565	34565	She	107	Valancy’s—“don’t let ’s talk any more about my being sick . Let ’s just forget it . Let ’s pretend I ’m a little girl again — and you have come here to play with me . I used to wish that long ago — wish that you could come . I knew you could n’t , of course . But how I did wish it ! You always seemed so different from the other girls — so kind and sweet — and as if you had something in yourself nobody knew about — some dear , pretty secret . Had you , Valancy ? ”
34712	34719	34721	34721	Valancy	107	“ I had my Blue Castle , ”
34772	34783	34785	34785	Cissy	182	“ Every one has a Blue Castle , I think , ”
34788	34805	34785	34785	Cissy	182	“ Only every one has a different name for it . I had mine — once . ”
35176	35184	35170	35170	his	1149	“ Good - evening , Miss Stirling . ”
35285	35294	35295	35295	Barney	140	“ I ’m going over to the Port , ”
35299	35315	35295	35295	Barney	140	“ Can I acquire merit by getting or doing anything there for you or Cissy ? ”
35316	35326	35328	35328	Valancy	107	“ Will you get some salt codfish for us ? ”
35389	35421	35376	35376	she	107	“ Certainly . You ’re sure there ’s nothing else ? Lots of room in Lady Jane Grey Slosson . And she always gets back some time , does Lady Jane . ”
35422	35432	35434	35434	Valancy	107	“ I do n’t think there ’s anything more , ”
35473	35502	35466	35466	he	1163	“ Miss Stirling , you ’re a brick ! You ’re a whole cartload of bricks . To come here and look after Cissy — under the circumstances . ”
35503	35512	35514	35514	Valancy	107	“ There ’s nothing so bricky about that , ”
35516	35564	35466	35466	he	1163	“ I ’d nothing else to do . And — I like it here . I do n’t feel as if I ’d done anything specially meritorious . Mr. Gay is paying me fair wages . I never earned any money before — and I like it . ”
35599	35617	35619	35619	Barney	140	“ All the money in the world could n’t buy what you ’re doing for Cissy Gay , ”
35621	35663	35619	35619	Barney	140	“ It ’s splendid and fine of you . And if there ’s anything I can do to help you in any way , you have only to let me know . If Roaring Abel ever tries to annoy you — — ”
35664	35680	35682	35682	Valancy	107	“ He does n’t . He ’s lovely to me . I like Roaring Abel , ”
35685	35713	35619	35619	Barney	140	“ So do I. But there ’s one stage of his drunkenness — perhaps you have n’t encountered it yet — when he sings ribald songs — — ”
35714	35763	35619	35619	Barney	140	“ Oh , yes . He came home last night like that . Cissy and I just went to our room and shut ourselves in where we could n’t hear him . He apologised this morning . I ’m not afraid of any of Roaring Abel ’s stages . ”
35764	35783	35785	35785	Barney	140	“ Well , I ’m sure he ’ll be decent to you , apart from his inebriated yowls , ”
35787	35805	35785	35785	Barney	140	“ And I ’ve told him he ’s got to stop damning things when you ’re around . ”
35806	35809	35811	35811	Valancy	107	“ Why ? ”
35847	35856	35837	35838	Barney Snaith	140	“ I often feel like damning things myself . ”
35902	35930	35899	35899	he	1166	“ It will be a relief to have some one to do it for you , then . So you do n’t want anything but salt codfish ? ”
35931	35971	35899	35899	he	1166	“ Not tonight . But I dare say I ’ll have some errands for you very often when you go to Port Lawrence . I ca n’t trust Mr. Gay to remember to bring all the things I want . ”
36170	36177	36179	36179	Cissy	182	“ But he is n’t bad , ”
36181	36202	36179	36179	Cissy	182	“ Nobody need ever tell me he is . He ca n’t have done a thing to be ashamed of . ”
36203	36213	36215	36215	Valancy	107	“ Then why does he live as he does ? ”
36223	36262	36179	36179	Cissy	182	“ I do n’t know . He ’s a mystery . And of course there ’s something behind it , but I know it is n’t disgrace . Barney Snaith simply could n’t do anything disgraceful , Valancy . ”
36415	36432	36433	36433	Cissy	182	“ You do n’t know what Barney has been to me , these past two years , ”
36438	36447	36433	36433	Cissy	182	“ Everything would have been unbearable without him . ”
36448	36476	36477	36477	Barney	140	“ Cissy Gay is the sweetest girl I ever knew — and there ’s a man somewhere I ’d like to shoot if I could find him , ”
36536	36538	36528	36528	Barney	140	“ shacks ”
36646	36651	36652	36652	he	1166	“ Found no gold , ”
36655	36691	36652	36652	he	1166	“ Came away poorer than when I went . But such a place to live ! Those silences at the back of the north wind got me . I ’ve never belonged to myself since . ”
36737	36750	36752	36752	Valancy	107	“ I like a man whose eyes say more than his lips , ”
36865	36875	36876	36876	he	1166	“ I ’ve been watching a woodpecker all day , ”
37139	37142	37144	37144	Barney	140	“ Piffle , ”
37228	37232	37234	37234	Valancy	107	“ But why ? ”
37245	37264	37234	37234	Valancy	107	“ I ’m doing honest work for honest pay . What is there in that that is disgraceful ? ”
37265	37272	37274	37275	Uncle James	107	“ Do n’t quibble , Valancy , ”
37278	37313	37274	37275	Uncle James	107	“ This is no fit place for you to be , and you know it . Why , I ’m told that jail - bird , Snaith , is hanging around here every evening . ”
37314	37319	37321	37321	Valancy	107	“ Not every evening , ”
37324	37332	37321	37321	Valancy	107	“ No , not quite every evening . ”
37333	37340	37342	37343	Uncle James	107	“ It’s — it ’s insufferable ! ”
37346	37374	37342	37343	Uncle James	107	“ Valancy , you must come home . We wo n’t judge you harshly . I assure you we wo n’t . We will overlook all this . ”
37375	37379	37381	37381	Valancy	107	“ Thank you , ”
37383	37391	37393	37394	Uncle James	107	“ Have you no sense of shame ? ”
37396	37417	37418	37418	Valancy	107	“ Oh , yes . But the things I am ashamed of are not the things you are ashamed of . ”
37444	37479	37441	37441	his	1199	“ We know your mind is n’t just right . We ’ll make allowances . But you must come home . You shall not stay here with that drunken , blasphemous old scoundrel — — ”
37480	37493	37495	37496	Roaring Abel	141	“ Were you by any chance referring to me , Mister Stirling ? ”
37518	37523	37508	37508	he	141	“ old Jim Stirling ’s ”
37552	37597	37529	37529	His	141	“ I was . And , furthermore , I want to tell you that you have acted an iniquitous part in luring this weak and unfortunate girl away from her home and friends , and I will have you punished yet for it — — ”
37653	37662	37663	37663	he	141	“ The next time you come back here , ”
37666	37698	37663	37663	he	141	“ I ’ll throw you through the window — and all the better if the window is shut ! Coming here , thinking yourself God to put the world to rights ! ”
37766	37833	37761	37761	his	141	“ He ’ll think of that for years when he wakes up in the night . The Almighty made a mistake in making so many Stirlings . But since they are made , we ’ve got to reckon with them . Too many to kill out . But if they come here bothering you I ’ll shoo ’em off before a cat could lick its ear . ”
37999	38009	37996	37996	He	131	“ Can you tell me where I ’m going ? ”
38010	38024	38026	38026	Abel	141	“ How the devil should I know where you ’re going , gosling ? ”
38136	38140	38142	38143	Dr. Stalling	131	“ Mr. Gay , ”
38148	38160	38142	38143	Dr. Stalling	131	“ may I see Miss Stirling alone for a few minutes ? ”
38209	38216	38217	38217	he	141	“ No , no , mister , ”
38221	38266	38217	38217	he	141	“ That would n’t do — wouldn’t do at all . I ’ve got the reputation of my household to keep up . I ’ve got to chaperone this young lady . Ca n’t have any sparkin ’ going on here behind my back . ”
38291	38300	38301	38301	he	141	“ D’ye know anything about it , anyway ? ”
38305	38309	38318	38320	Poor Dr. Stalling	131	“ About what ? ”
38310	38313	38315	38315	Abel	141	“ Sparking , ”
38353	38384	38386	38386	his	131	“ Miss Stirling , I am here in response to your mother ’s wishes . She begged me to come . I am charged with some messages from her . Will you”—he
38387	38392	38343	38343	his	131	forefinger—“will you hear them ? ”
38393	38396	38398	38398	Valancy	107	“ Yes , ”
38413	38428	38398	38398	Valancy	107	“ The first is this . If you will leave this — this — — ”
38429	38432	38434	38435	Roaring Abel	141	“ House , ”
38437	38461	38434	38435	Roaring Abel	141	“ H - o - u - s - e. Troubled with an impediment in your speech , ai n’t you , Mister ? ”
38462	38491	38398	38398	Valancy	107	“ — this place and return to your home , Mr. James Stirling will himself pay for a good nurse to come here and wait on Miss Gay . ”
38542	38550	38552	38552	Abel	141	“ That ’s my business , Mister , ”
38554	38667	38552	38552	Abel	141	“ Miss Stirling can go if she pleases , or stay if she pleases . I made a fair bargain with her , and she ’s free to conclude it when she likes . She gives me meals that stick to my ribs . She do n’t forget to put salt in the porridge . She never slams doors , and when she has nothing to say she do n’t talk . That ’s uncanny in a woman , you know , Mister . I ’m satisfied . If she is n’t , she ’s free to go . But no woman comes here in Jim Stirling ’s pay . If any one does”—Abel
38674	38691	38552	38552	Abel	141	polite—“I’ll spatter the road with her brains . Tell him that with A. Gay ’s compliments . ”
38692	38704	38706	38706	Valancy	107	“ Dr. Stalling , a nurse is not what Cissy needs , ”
38709	38746	38706	38706	Valancy	107	“ She is n’t so ill as that , yet . What she wants is companionship — somebody she knows and likes just to live with her . You can understand that , I ’m sure . ”
38747	38760	38761	38762	Dr. Stalling	131	“ I understand that your motive is quite — ahem — commendable . ”
38826	38858	38818	38818	he	131	“ But your first duty is to your mother . She needs you . She implores you to come home — she will forgive everything if you will only come home . ”
38859	38867	38869	38869	Abel	141	“ That ’s a pretty little thought , ”
38887	38895	38882	38883	Dr. Stalling	131	“ She entreats , but I , Miss Stirling,”—Dr
38905	38937	38900	38900	he	131	Jehovah—“I command . As your pastor and spiritual guide , I command you to come home with me — this very day . Get your hat and coat and come now . ”
38956	38962	38964	38965	Roaring Abel	141	“ She ’s giving in , ”
38967	38986	38964	38965	Roaring Abel	141	“ She ’ll go with him . Beats all , the power these preacher fellows have over women . ”
39076	39083	39125	39125	Valancy	107	“ Fear is the original sin , ”
39102	39124	39125	39125	Valancy	107	“ Almost all the evil in the world has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of something . ”
39156	39160	39161	39161	she	107	“ Dr. Stalling , ”
39165	39213	39161	39161	she	107	“ I do not at present owe any duty to my mother . She is quite well ; she has all the assistance and companionship she requires ; she does not need me at all . I am needed here . I am going to stay here . ”
39214	39221	39223	39224	Roaring Abel	141	“ There ’s spunk for you , ”
39243	39263	39227	39228	Dr. Stalling	131	“ Miss Stirling , is there nothing that can influence you ? Do you remember your childhood days — — ”
39264	39271	39227	39228	Dr. Stalling	131	“ Perfectly . And hate them . ”
39272	39286	39227	39228	Dr. Stalling	131	“ Do you realise what people will say ? What they are saying ? ”
39287	39293	39295	39295	Valancy	107	“ I can imagine it , ”
39312	39354	39304	39304	She	107	“ I have n’t listened to the gossip of Deerwood teaparties and sewing circles twenty years for nothing . But , Dr. Stalling , it does n’t matter in the least to me what they say — not in the least . ”
39453	39497	39450	39450	she	110	“ And now that you have got all that out of your system , Cousin Georgiana , can you tell me how to make creamed codfish so that it will not be as thick as porridge and as salt as the Dead Sea ? ”
39505	39513	39515	39516	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ We ’ll just have to wait , ”
39518	39540	39515	39516	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ After all , Cissy Gay ca n’t live long . Dr. Marsh tells me she may drop off any day . ”
39675	39676	39659	39659	She	107	“ home”—but
39938	39940	39980	39980	He	1231	“ up back”—a
40109	40113	40107	40107	she	107	“ turned Free Methodist ”
40192	40204	40190	40190	He	141	“ no use for Free Methodists . He was a Presbyterian . ”
40213	40225	40226	40227	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ We ’ll hear something worse than that about her soon , ”
40258	40261	40234	40234	Valancy	107	“ up back ”
40331	40340	40341	40341	he	141	“ You come with me to the dance , ”
40344	40370	40341	40341	he	141	“ It ’ll do you good — put some colour in your face . You look peaked — you want something to liven you up . ”
40716	40729	40731	40731	Cissy	182	“ You look so nice and — and — different , dear , ”
40733	40754	40731	40731	Cissy	182	“ Like a green moonbeam with a gleam of red in it , if there could be such a thing . ”
40761	40774	40755	40755	Valancy	107	“ I do n’t feel right about leaving you alone , Cissy . ”
40775	40893	40755	40755	Valancy	107	“ Oh , I ’ll be all right . I feel better tonight than I have for a long while . I ’ve been feeling badly to see you sticking here so closely on my account . I hope you ’ll have a nice time . I never was at a party at the Corners , but I used to go sometimes , long ago , to dances up back . We always had good times . And you need n’t be afraid of Father being drunk tonight . He never drinks when he engages to play for a party . But — there may be — liquor . What will you do if it gets rough ? ”
40894	40900	40755	40755	Valancy	107	“ Nobody would molest me . ”
40901	40924	40755	40755	Valancy	107	“ Not seriously , I suppose . Father would see to that . But it might be noisy and — and unpleasant . ”
40925	40970	40755	40755	Valancy	107	“ I wo n’t mind . I ’m only going as a looker - on . I do n’t expect to dance . I just want to see what a party up back is like . I ’ve never seen anything except decorous Deerwood . ”
40985	40988	40755	40755	Valancy	107	“ up back ”
41005	41015	41016	41016	she	182	“ I hope you ’ll enjoy it , dear , ”
41135	41139	41141	41141	he	141	“ up back , ”
41221	41224	41217	41235	a couple of nice “ up back ” boys who danced beautifully and told her she did , too	1264	“ up back ”
41275	41278	41274	41280	the “ up back ” young men	1265	“ up back ”
41287	41291	41274	41280	the “ up back ” young men	1265	“ lean - to ”
41295	41304	41274	41280	the “ up back ” young men	1265	“ Know who that girl in green is ? ”
41305	41327	41274	41280	the “ up back ” young men	1265	“ Nope . Guess she ’s from out front . The Port , maybe . Got a stylish look to her . ”
41328	41346	41274	41280	the “ up back ” young men	1265	“ No beaut but cute - looking , I ’ll say . ‘ Jever see such eyes ? ”
41385	41388	41384	41389	The “ up back ” girls	1268	“ up back ”
41454	41461	41466	41466	them	1272	“ come - all - ye ’s ”
41964	42021	41955	41955	His	1287	“ We wo n’t have fine - lady airs here , my girl . If you ai n’t too good to come here you ai n’t too good to dance with us . Me and my pals have been watching you . You ’ve got to give us each a turn and a kiss to boot . ”
42083	42089	42094	42094	He	1294	“ This way — quick , ”
42115	42129	42094	42094	He	1294	“ Quick — we must run for it — they’ll be after us . ”
42284	42287	42288	42288	she	107	“ Thanks , ”
42291	42304	42306	42306	Barney	140	“ What a goose you were to come to such a place ! ”
42308	42323	42325	42325	Valancy	107	“ I — didn’t — know — it — would — be like this , ”
42327	42336	42351	42351	Valancy	107	“ You should have known . Chidley Corners ! ”
42337	42350	42351	42351	Valancy	107	“ It — was — just — a name — to me . ”
42364	42368	42369	42369	She	140	“ up back . ”
42404	42472	42473	42473	Valancy	107	“ When I drifted in at Abel ’s this evening and Cissy told me you ’d come here I was amazed . And downright scared . Cissy told me she was worried about you but had n’t liked to say anything to dissuade you for fear you ’d think she was thinking selfishly about herself . So I came on up here instead of going to Deerwood . ”
42499	42540	42489	42489	he	1300	“ As soon as they stop hunting for us we ’ll sneak around to the Muskoka road . I left Lady Jane down there . I ’ll take you home . I suppose you ’ve had enough of your party . ”
42541	42544	42546	42546	Valancy	107	“ Quite , ”
42837	42882	42813	42814	Lady Jane	210	“ I ’m a doddering idiot . Out of gas . I knew I was short when I left home , but I meant to fill up in Deerwood . Then I forgot all about it in my hurry to get to the Corners . ”
42883	42889	42891	42891	Valancy	107	“ What can we do ? ”
42894	42992	42813	42814	Lady Jane	210	“ I do n’t know . There ’s no gas nearer than Deerwood , nine miles away . And I do n’t dare leave you here alone . There are always tramps on this road — and some of those crazy fools back at the Corners may come straggling along presently . There were boys there from the Port . As far as I can see , the best thing to do is for us just to sit patiently here until some car comes along and lends us enough gas to get to Roaring Abel ’s with . ”
42993	43003	43005	43005	Valancy	107	“ Well , what ’s the matter with that ? ”
43007	43017	43019	43019	Barney	140	“ We may have to sit here all night , ”
43021	43027	43029	43029	Valancy	107	“ I do n’t mind , ”
43037	43055	43031	43031	Barney	140	“ If you do n’t , I need n’t . I have n’t any reputation to lose . ”
43056	43060	43062	43062	Valancy	107	“ Nor I , ”
43067	43074	43076	43076	Barney	140	“ We ’ll just sit here , ”
43078	43108	43076	43076	Barney	140	“ and if we think of anything worth while saying we ’ll say it . Otherwise , not . Do n’t imagine you ’re bound to talk to me . ”
43109	43114	43116	43116	Valancy	107	“ John Foster says , ”
43118	43167	43116	43116	Valancy	107	“ ‘ If you can sit in silence with a person for half an hour and yet be entirely comfortable , you and that person can be friends . If you can not , friends you ’ll never be and you need not waste time in trying . ’ ”
43168	43181	43183	43183	Barney	140	“ Evidently John Foster says a sensible thing once in a while , ”
43823	43829	43831	43831	Barney	140	“ Ever dream of ballooning ? ”
43834	43837	43839	43839	Valancy	107	“ No , ”
43841	43890	43899	43899	Valancy	107	“ I do — often . Dream of sailing through the clouds — seeing the glories of sunset — spending hours in the midst of a terrific storm with lightning playing above and below you — skimming above a silver cloud floor under a full moon — wonderful ! ”
43891	43897	43899	43899	Valancy	107	“ It does sound so , ”
43901	43911	43899	43899	Valancy	107	“ I ’ve stayed on earth in my dreams . ”
43974	43978	43962	43962	She	107	“ up back . ”
43979	43990	43991	43991	she	107	“ You see — I’ve never had any real life , ”
43994	44010	43991	43991	she	107	“ I ’ve just — breathed . Every door has always been shut to me . ”
44011	44018	44020	44020	Barney	140	“ But you ’re still young , ”
44022	44042	44044	44044	Valancy	107	“ Oh , I know . Yes , I ’m ‘ still young’—but that ’s so different from young , ”
44082	44090	44091	44091	she	107	“ Though I never was really young , ”
44093	44096	44097	44097	she	107	on—“until tonight , ”
44103	44118	44097	44097	she	107	“ I never had a life like other girls . You could n’t understand . Why,”—she
44130	44150	44097	44097	she	107	her—“I did n’t even love my mother . Is n’t it awful that I do n’t love my mother ? ”
44151	44158	44160	44160	Barney	140	“ Rather awful — for her , ”
44163	44224	44097	44097	she	107	“ Oh , she did n’t know it . She took my love for granted . And I was n’t any use or comfort to her or anybody . I was just a — a — vegetable . And I got tired of it . That ’s why I came to keep house for Mr. Gay and look after Cissy . ”
44225	44237	44097	44097	she	107	“ And I suppose your people thought you ’d gone mad . ”
44238	44247	44249	44249	Valancy	107	“ They did — and do — literally , ”
44251	44316	44249	44249	Valancy	107	“ But it ’s a comfort to them . They ’d rather believe me mad than bad . There ’s no other alternative . But I ’ve been living since I came to Mr. Gay ’s . It ’s been a delightful experience . I suppose I ’ll pay for it when I have to go back — but I ’ll have had it . ”
44317	44322	44324	44324	Barney	140	“ That ’s true , ”
44326	44367	44324	44324	Barney	140	“ If you buy your experience it ’s your own . So it ’s no matter how much you pay for it . Somebody else ’s experience can never be yours . Well , it ’s a funny old world . ”
44368	44377	44379	44379	Valancy	107	“ Do you think it really is old ? ”
44382	44412	44379	44379	Valancy	107	“ I never believe that in June . It seems so young tonight — somehow . In that quivering moonlight — like a young , white girl — waiting . ”
44413	44429	44431	44431	Barney	140	“ Moonlight here on the verge of up back is different from moonlight anywhere else , ”
44433	44461	44431	44431	Barney	140	“ It always makes me feel so clean , somehow — body and soul . And of course the age of gold always comes back in spring . ”
44507	44512	44513	44513	he	1339	“ Put that on , ”
44516	44524	44526	44526	Valancy	107	“ Do n’t you want it yourself ? ”
44528	44544	44487	44487	Barney	140	“ No . I ’m not going to have you catching cold on my hands . ”
44545	44598	44513	44513	he	1339	“ Oh , I wo n’t catch cold . I have n’t had a cold since I came to Mr. Gay’s — though I ’ve done the foolishest things . It ’s funny , too — I used to have them all the time . I feel so selfish taking your coat . ”
44599	44621	44622	44622	He	1339	“ You ’ve sneezed three times . No use winding up your ‘ experience ’ up back with grippe or pneumonia . ”
44680	44684	44685	44685	Barney	140	“ up back . ”
44763	44777	44778	44778	Barney	140	“ Can you let me have enough gas to take me to Deerwood ? ”
44792	44800	44801	44801	he	95	“ Valancy , how came you here ! ”
44805	44813	44815	44815	Valancy	107	“ By chance or God ’s grace , ”
44817	44830	44832	44833	Uncle Wellington	95	“ With this jail - bird — at ten o’clock at night ! ”
44858	44866	44835	44835	Valancy	107	“ Are you a jail - bird ? ”
44867	44872	44874	44874	Barney	140	“ Does it matter ? ”
44883	44895	44897	44897	Valancy	107	“ Not to me . I only asked out of curiosity , ”
44899	44912	44913	44913	He	95	“ Then I wo n’t tell you . I never satisfy curiosity . ”
44924	44958	44919	44919	his	95	“ Mr. Stirling , I asked you if you could let me have some gas . If you can , well and good . If not , we are only delaying you unnecessarily . ”
45022	45030	45031	45031	he	95	“ Got anything to get gas in ? ”
45171	45179	45181	45181	Olive	175	“ She got it from the Wansbarras , ”
45184	45196	45181	45181	Olive	175	“ There ’s nothing like that in the Stirlings — nothing ! ”
45197	45207	45208	45208	Cecil	102	“ I hope not — I certainly hope not , ”
45213	45236	45208	45208	Cecil	102	“ But then — to go out as a servant — for that is what it practically amounts to . Your cousin ! ”
45257	45261	45268	45268	She	107	“ worked out . ”
45272	45279	45268	45268	She	107	“ Olive , does it hurt ? ”
45285	45290	45268	45268	She	107	“ Does what hurt ? ”
45291	45296	45268	45268	She	107	“ Looking like that . ”
45323	45326	45327	45327	she	101	“ Doss , ”
45334	45345	45327	45327	she	101	“ wo n’t you come home — come home tonight ? ”
45349	45357	45358	45358	she	101	“ You sound like a revival meeting , ”
45361	45366	45358	45358	she	101	“ You really do . ”
45367	45375	45327	45327	she	101	“ If you will come back — — ”
45376	45382	45358	45358	she	101	“ All will be forgiven . ”
45383	45386	45388	45388	Olive	101	“ Yes , ”
45406	45431	45397	45397	she	107	“ We ’ll never cast it up to you . Doss , there are nights when I can not sleep for thinking of you . ”
45432	45442	45444	45444	Valancy	107	“ And me having the time of my life , ”
45448	45470	45397	45397	she	107	“ Doss , I ca n’t believe you ’re bad . I ’ve always said you could n’t be bad — — ”
45471	45480	45482	45482	Valancy	107	“ I do n’t believe I can be , ”
45484	45525	45482	45482	Valancy	107	“ I ’m afraid I ’m hopelessly proper . I ’ve been sitting here for three hours with Barney Snaith and he has n’t even tried to kiss me . I would n’t have minded if he had , Olive . ”
45612	45619	45621	45621	Barney	140	“ Thanks — that ’s enough , ”
45626	45642	45621	45621	Barney	140	“ Much obliged , Mr. Stirling . Two gallons — seventy cents . Thank you . ”
45712	45716	45718	45718	Olive	101	“ Drive on , ”
45721	45740	45718	45718	Olive	101	“ There ’s no use in waiting here . Let me tell you what she said to me . ”
45741	45751	45753	45754	Uncle Wellington	95	“ The little hussy ! The shameless little hussy ! ”
45831	45846	45808	45808	Barney	140	“ I ’m going to the Port . Will you go there with me ? ”
45882	45885	45871	45871	she	107	“ hopped in ”
46053	46059	46060	46060	she	99	“ Was it for this , ”
46066	46075	46060	46060	she	99	“ that I suffered the pangs of motherhood ? ”
46076	46082	46084	46085	Cousin Stickles	97	“ I will not believe , ”
46088	46098	46084	46085	Cousin Stickles	97	“ that our prayers will not yet be answered . ”
46099	46113	46115	46116	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Who — who will protect that unfortunate girl when I am gone ? ”
46615	46763	47044	47044	Valancy	107	“ He was stopping at the hotel across the lake . He used to come over in his canoe at night — we met in the pines down the shore . He was a young college student — his father was a rich man in Toronto . Oh , Valancy , I did n’t mean to be bad — I did n’t , indeed . But I loved him so — I love him yet — I’ll always love him . And I — didn’t know — some things . I didn’t — understand . Then his father came and took him away . And — after a little — I found out — oh , Valancy,—I was so frightened . I did n’t know what to do . I wrote him — and he came . He — he said he would marry me , Valancy . ”
46764	46773	47044	47044	Valancy	107	“ And why — and why ? — — ”
46774	46840	47044	47044	Valancy	107	“ Oh , Valancy , he did n’t love me any more . I saw that at a glance . He — he was just offering to marry me because he thought he ought to — because he was sorry for me . He was n’t bad — but he was so young — and what was I that he should keep on loving me ? ”
46841	46849	46851	46851	Valancy	107	“ Never mind making excuses for him , ”
46856	46864	46851	46851	Valancy	107	“ So you would n’t marry him ? ”
46865	46919	47044	47044	Valancy	107	“ I couldn’t — not when he did n’t love me any more . Somehow — I ca n’t explain — it seemed a worse thing to do than — the other . He — he argued a little — but he went away . Do you think I did right , Valancy ? ”
46920	46934	46851	46851	Valancy	107	“ Yes , I do . You did right . But he — — ”
46935	46981	47044	47044	Valancy	107	“ Do n’t blame him , dear . Please do n’t . Let ’s not talk about him at all . There ’s no need . I wanted to tell you how it was — I did n’t want you to think me bad — — ”
46982	46989	46851	46851	Valancy	107	“ I never did think so . ”
46990	47036	47044	47044	Valancy	107	“ Yes , I felt that — whenever you came . Oh , Valancy , what you ’ve been to me ! I can never tell you — but God will bless you for it . I know He will—‘with what measure ye mete . ’ ”
47054	47174	46851	46851	Valancy	107	“ Well , that ’s almost all . I came home . I was n’t really so very unhappy . I suppose I should have been — but I was n’t . Father was n’t hard on me . And my baby was so sweet while he lived . I was even happy — I loved him so much , the dear little thing . He was so sweet , Valancy — with such lovely blue eyes — and little rings of pale gold hair like silk floss — and tiny dimpled hands . I used to bite his satin - smooth little face all over — softly , so as not to hurt him , you know — — ”
47175	47179	47181	47181	Valancy	107	“ I know , ”
47185	47198	47181	47181	Valancy	107	“ I know — a woman always knows — and dreams — — ”
47199	47325	46851	46851	Valancy	107	“ And he was all mine . Nobody else had any claim on him . When he died , oh , Valancy , I thought I must die too — I did n’t see how anybody could endure such anguish and live . To see his dear little eyes and know he would never open them again — to miss his warm little body nestled against mine at night and think of him sleeping alone and cold , his wee face under the hard frozen earth . It was so awful for the first year — after that it was a little easier , one did n’t keep thinking ‘ this day last year’—but I was so glad when I found out I was dying . ”
47326	47343	47345	47345	Valancy	107	“ ‘ Who could endure life if it were not for the hope of death ? ’ ”
47362	47374	47376	47376	Cissy	182	“ I ’m glad I ’ve told you all about it , ”
47378	47385	47376	47376	Cissy	182	“ I wanted you to know . ”
47426	47508	47411	47411	she	107	“ Valancy , why should you ? He can do nothing for me . I ’ve known for several days that — this — was near . Let me die in peace , dear — just holding your hand . Oh , I ’m so glad you ’re here . Tell Father good - bye for me . He ’s always been as good to me as he knew how — and Barney . Somehow , I think that Barney — — ”
47815	47822	47823	47823	he	141	“ Cissy dead — Cissy dead , ”
47827	47878	47823	47823	he	141	“ I did n’t think it would ‘ a ’ come so soon . Dead . She used to run down the lane to meet me with a little white rose stuck in her hair . Cissy used to be a pretty little girl . And a good little girl . ”
47879	47889	47891	47891	Valancy	107	“ She has always been a good little girl , ”
47977	47980	47983	47983	They	1403	“ up back ”

48660	48663	48625	48625	She	107	“ up back ”
48685	48722	48681	48681	Cissy	182	“ I wish I could be buried deep in the heart of the woods where nobody would ever come to say , ‘ Cissy Gay is buried here , ’ and tell over my miserable story . ”
48789	48793	48794	48794	she	99	“ My child , ”
48798	48805	48794	48794	she	99	“ you ’ll come home now ? ”
48806	48809	48811	48811	Valancy	107	“ Home , ”
48839	48841	48814	48814	She	107	“ up back”—distant
48873	48878	48880	48881	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Yes , home , ”
48889	48906	48880	48881	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ I suppose you wo n’t dream of staying here now — alone with Roaring Abel . ”
48907	48920	48922	48922	Valancy	107	“ Oh , no , I ’m not going to stay here , ”
48924	48972	48922	48922	Valancy	107	“ Of course , I ’ll have to stay for a day or two , to put the house in order generally . But that will be all . Excuse me , Mother , wo n’t you ? I ’ve a frightful lot to do — all those “
48975	48983	48880	48881	Mrs. Frederick	99	” people will be here to supper . ”
49000	49016	49018	49019	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ We will just treat her as if nothing had happened when she comes back , ”
49021	49036	49018	49019	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ That will be the best plan . Just as if nothing had happened . ”
49100	49103	49087	49088	Roaring Abel	141	“ up back ”
49138	49246	49087	49088	Roaring Abel	141	“ She wo n’t be like you , my girl . Well , I ’m obliged to you . You helped me out of a bad hole and I wo n’t forget it . And I wo n’t forget what you did for Cissy . I ’m your friend , and if you ever want any of the Stirlings spanked and sot in a corner send for me . I ’m going to wet my whistle . Lord , but I ’m dry ! Do n’t reckon I ’ll be back afore tomorrow night , so if you ’re going home tomorrow , good - bye now . ”
49247	49254	49256	49256	Valancy	107	“ I may go home tomorrow , ”
49258	49268	49256	49256	Valancy	107	“ but I ’m not going back to Deerwood . ”
49269	49274	49087	49088	Roaring Abel	141	“ Not going — — ”
49275	49286	49288	49288	Valancy	107	“ You ’ll find the key on the woodshed nail , ”
49294	49351	49288	49288	Valancy	107	“ The dog will be in the barn and the cat in the cellar . Do n’t forget to feed her till your cousin comes . The pantry is full and I made bread and pies today . Good - bye , Mr. Gay . You have been very kind to me and I appreciate it . ”
49352	49372	49374	49375	Roaring Abel	141	“ We ’ve had a d —— d decent time of it together , and that ’s a fact , ”
49377	49409	49374	49375	Roaring Abel	141	“ You ’re the best small sport in the world , and your little finger is worth the whole Stirling clan tied together . Good - bye and good - luck . ”
49554	49561	49537	49537	he	141	“ Going home , Miss Stirling ? ”
49562	49570	49572	49572	Valancy	107	“ I do n’t know — yet , ”
49594	49613	49615	49615	Barney	140	“ I thought I ’d run down and ask if there was anything I could do for you , ”
49624	49636	49637	49637	she	107	“ Yes , there is something you can do for me , ”
49644	49650	49637	49637	she	107	“ Will you marry me ? ”
49674	49701	49668	49668	he	141	“ Come , now ! I knew luck was just waiting around the corner for me . All the signs have been pointing that way today . ”
49702	49705	49706	49706	Valancy	107	“ Wait . ”
49711	49755	49706	49706	Valancy	107	“ I ’m in earnest — but I want to get my breath after that question . Of course , with my bringing up , I realise perfectly well that this is one of the things ‘ a lady should not do . ’ ”
49756	49762	49777	49777	she	107	“ But why — why ? ”
49763	49768	49769	49769	Valancy	107	“ For two reasons . ”
49821	49829	49866	49866	She	107	“ The first reason is , I — I”—Valancy
49833	49837	49866	49866	She	107	“ I love you ”
49852	49865	49842	49842	She	107	“ I ’m crazy about you . The second is — this . ”
49913	49924	49902	49902	He	1457	“ Are you sure nothing can be done for you ? ”
49932	49987	49925	49925	Valancy	107	“ Yes . You know Dr. Trent ’s reputation in regard to heart disease . I have n’t long to live — perhaps only a few months — a few weeks . I want to live them . I ca n’t go back to Deerwood — you know what my life was like there . And”—she
49991	50011	49925	49925	Valancy	107	time—“I love you . I want to spend the rest of my life with you . That ’s all . ”
50042	50058	50012	50012	Barney	140	“ You do n’t know anything about me . I may be a — murderer . ”
50059	50089	50130	50130	Valancy	107	“ No , I do n’t . You may be something dreadful . Everything they say of you may be true . But it does n’t matter to me . ”
50090	50100	50102	50102	Barney	140	“ You care that much for me , Valancy ? ”
50121	50128	50130	50130	Valancy	107	“ I care — that much , ”
50173	50182	50184	50184	Barney	140	“ If we are going to get married , ”
50199	50206	50184	50184	Barney	140	“ some things must be understood . ”
50207	50213	50215	50215	Valancy	107	“ Everything must be understood , ”
50217	50226	50228	50228	Barney	140	“ I have things I want to hide , ”
50231	50241	50228	50228	Barney	140	“ You are not to ask me about them . ”
50242	50247	50249	50249	Valancy	107	“ I wo n’t , ”
50251	50261	50184	50184	Barney	140	“ You must never ask to see my mail . ”
50262	50265	50184	50184	Barney	140	“ Never . ”
50266	50278	50184	50184	Barney	140	“ And we are never to pretend anything to each other . ”
50279	50284	50286	50286	Valancy	107	“ We wo n’t , ”
50288	50315	50286	50286	Valancy	107	“ You wo n’t even have to pretend you like me . If you marry me I know you ’re only doing it out of pity . ”
50316	50338	50184	50184	Barney	140	“ And we ’ll never tell a lie to each other about anything — a big lie or a petty lie . ”
50339	50345	50347	50347	Valancy	107	“ Especially a petty lie , ”
50349	50368	50184	50184	Barney	140	“ And you ’ll have to live back on my island . I wo n’t live anywhere else . ”
50369	50380	50382	50382	Valancy	107	“ That ’s partly why I want to marry you , ”
50389	50405	50384	50384	Barney	140	“ I believe you mean it . Well — let ’s get married , then . ”
50406	50410	50412	50412	Valancy	107	“ Thank you , ”
50434	50533	50384	50384	Barney	140	“ I suppose I have n’t any right to make conditions . But I ’m going to make one . You are never to refer to my heart or my liability to sudden death . You are never to urge me to be careful . You are to forget — absolutely forget — that I ’m not perfectly healthy . I have written a letter to my mother — here it is — you are to keep it . I have explained everything in it . If I drop dead suddenly — as I likely will do — — ”
50534	50553	50555	50555	Barney	140	“ It will exonerate me in the eyes of your kindred from the suspicion of having poisoned you , ”
50560	50563	50564	50564	Valancy	107	“ Exactly . ”
50568	50625	50564	50564	Valancy	107	“ Dear me , I ’m glad this is over . It has been — a bit of an ordeal . You see , I ’m not in the habit of going about asking men to marry me . It is so nice of you not to refuse me — or offer to be a brother ! ”
50626	50652	50564	50564	Valancy	107	“ I ’ll go to the Port tomorrow and get a license . We can be married tomorrow evening . Dr. Stalling , I suppose ? ”
50653	50658	50659	50659	Valancy	107	“ Heavens , no . ”
50662	50699	50659	50659	Valancy	107	“ Besides , he would n’t do it . He ’d shake his forefinger at me and I ’d jilt you at the altar . No , I want my old Mr. Towers to marry me . ”
50700	50709	50711	50711	Barney	140	“ Will you marry me as I stand ? ”
50745	50748	50749	50749	she	107	“ Yes , ”
50770	50773	50774	50774	he	1466	“ Valancy , ”
50782	50822	50774	50774	he	1466	“ of course I ’m not in love with you — never thought of such a thing as being in love . But , do you know , I ’ve always thought you were a bit of a dear . ”
50969	50972	50974	50974	Barney	140	“ Ready ? ”
50986	50989	50990	50990	Valancy	107	“ Yes . ”
51063	51070	51072	51072	Barney	140	“ Have n’t changed your mind ? ”
51074	51080	51072	51072	Barney	140	“ No . Have you ? ”
51081	51084	51072	51072	Barney	140	“ No . ”
51434	51446	51447	51448	Mr. Towers	222	“ Mrs. Snaith , I hope you will be very happy , ”
51475	51479	51480	51480	He	222	“ up back . ”
51558	51567	51568	51568	Barney	140	“ What a nice way to get married ! ”
51579	51596	51572	51572	he	1485	“ No fuss and flub - dub . I never supposed it was half so easy . ”
51597	51603	51605	51605	Valancy	107	“ For heaven ’s sake , ”
51608	51637	51605	51605	Valancy	107	“ let ’s forget we are married and talk as if we were n’t . I ca n’t stand another drive like the one we had coming in . ”
51651	51663	51664	51664	he	1485	“ And I thought I was making it easy for you , ”
51667	51677	51664	51664	he	1485	“ You did n’t seem to want to talk . ”
51678	51729	51572	51572	he	1485	“ I did n’t . But I wanted you to talk . I do n’t want you to make love to me , but I want you to act like an ordinary human being . Tell me about this island of yours . What sort of a place is it ? ”
51730	51897	51664	51664	he	1485	“ The jolliest place in the world . You ’re going to love it . The first time I saw it I loved it . Old Tom MacMurray owned it then . He built the little shack on it , lived there in winter and rented it to Toronto people in summer . I bought it from him — became by that one simple transaction a landed proprietor owning a house and an island . There is something so satisfying in owning a whole island . And is n’t an uninhabited island a charming idea ? I ’d wanted to own one ever since I ’d read Robinson Crusoe . It seemed too good to be true . And beauty ! Most of the scenery belongs to the government , but they do n’t tax you for looking at it , and the moon belongs to everybody . You wo n’t find my shack very tidy . I suppose you ’ll want to make it tidy . ”
51898	51901	51903	51903	Valancy	107	“ Yes , ”
51906	51937	51903	51903	Valancy	107	“ I have to be tidy . I do n’t really want to be . But untidiness hurts me . Yes , I ’ll have to tidy up your shack . ”
51938	51945	51947	51947	Barney	140	“ I was prepared for that , ”
51954	51957	51959	51959	Valancy	107	“ But , ”
51962	51977	51959	51959	Valancy	107	“ I wo n’t insist on your wiping your feet when you come in . ”
51978	51995	51997	51997	Barney	140	“ No , you ’ll only sweep up after me with the air of a martyr , ”
51999	52032	51997	51997	Barney	140	“ Well , anyway , you ca n’t tidy the lean - to . You ca n’t even enter it . The door will be locked and I shall keep the key . ”
52033	52038	52040	52040	Valancy	107	“ Bluebeard ’s chamber , ”
52042	52073	52040	52040	Valancy	107	“ I sha n’t even think of it . I do n’t care how many wives you have hanging up in it . So long as they ’re really dead . ”
52074	52293	51997	51997	Barney	140	“ Dead as door - nails . You can do as you like in the rest of the house . There ’s not much of it — just one big living - room and one small bedroom . Well built , though . Old Tom loved his job . The beams of our house are cedar and the rafters fir . Our living - room windows face west and east . It ’s wonderful to have a room where you can see both sunrise and sunset . I have two cats there . Banjo and Good Luck . Adorable animals . Banjo is a big , enchanting , grey devil - cat . Striped , of course . I do n’t care a hang for any cat that has n’t stripes . I never knew a cat who could swear as genteelly and effectively as Banjo . His only fault is that he snores horribly when he is asleep . Luck is a dainty little cat . Always looking wistfully at you , as if he wanted to tell you something . Maybe he will pull it off sometime . Once in a thousand years , you know , one cat is allowed to speak . My cats are philosophers — neither of them ever cries over spilt milk .
52294	52370	52040	52040	Valancy	107	“ Two old crows live in a pine - tree on the point and are reasonably neighbourly . Call ’em Nip and Tuck . And I have a demure little tame owl . Name , Leander . I brought him up from a baby and he lives over on the mainland and chuckles to himself o ’ nights . And bats — it ’s a great place for bats at night . Scared of bats ? ”
52371	52378	51997	51997	Barney	140	“ No ; I like them . ”
52379	52437	52040	52040	Valancy	107	“ So do I. Nice , queer , uncanny , mysterious creatures . Coming from nowhere — going nowhere . Swoop ! Banjo likes ’em , too . Eats ’em . I have a canoe and a disappearing propeller boat . Went to the Port in it today to get my license . Quieter than Lady Jane . ”
52438	52455	52457	52457	Valancy	107	“ I thought you had n’t gone at all — that you had changed your mind , ”
52477	52484	52485	52485	he	1487	“ I never change my mind , ”
52583	52589	52590	52590	he	1487	“ There ’s our island , ”
52677	52682	52683	52683	she	107	“ My Blue Castle ! ”
52686	52693	52683	52683	she	107	“ Oh , my Blue Castle ! ”
52782	52788	52789	52789	Barney	140	“ Welcome home , dear , ”
53140	53151	53156	53156	she	110	“ I suppose you ’re going home , dear Doss ? ”
53176	53181	53183	53183	Valancy	107	“ Sooner or later , ”
53186	53217	53156	53156	she	110	“ Then I ’ll go along with you . I ’ve been wanting to see you very especially , Doss dear . I ’ve something quite wonderful to tell you . ”
53218	53221	53223	53223	Valancy	107	“ Yes ? ”
53259	53272	53274	53275	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ Who do you suppose called to see me the other day ? ”
53283	53287	53288	53289	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ Edward Beck . ”
53298	53302	53291	53291	her	110	“ Edward Beck . ”
53313	53321	53323	53323	Valancy	107	“ Who on earth is Edward Beck ? ”
53330	53337	53338	53338	she	110	“ Surely you remember Edward Beck , ”
53342	53368	53338	53338	she	110	“ He lives in that lovely house on the Port Lawrence road and he comes to our church — regularly . You must remember him . ”
53369	53378	53380	53380	Valancy	107	“ Oh , I think I do now , ”
53388	53419	53380	53380	Valancy	107	“ He ’s that old man with a wen on his forehead and dozens of children , who always sits in the pew by the door , is n’t he ? ”
53420	53484	53338	53338	she	110	“ Not dozens of children , dear — oh , no , not dozens . Not even one dozen . Only nine . At least only nine that count . The rest are dead . He is n’t old — he ’s only about forty - eight — the prime of life , Doss — and what does it matter about a wen ? ”
53485	53491	53493	53493	Valancy	107	“ Nothing , of course , ”
53593	53597	53599	53600	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ My dear , ”
53602	53610	53599	53600	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ Edward Beck wants to marry you . ”
53637	53640	53633	53633	she	107	“ Me ? ”
53641	53711	53633	53633	she	107	“ Yes , you . He fell in love with you at the funeral . And he came to consult me about it . I was such a friend of his first wife , you know . He is very much in earnest , Dossie . And it ’s a wonderful chance for you . He ’s very well off — and you know — you — you — — ”
53712	53722	53724	53724	Valancy	107	“ Am not so young as I once was , ”
53726	53751	53724	53724	Valancy	107	“ ‘ To her that hath shall be given . ’ Do you really think I would make a good stepmother , Cousin Georgiana ? ”
53752	53767	53633	53633	she	107	“ I ’m sure you would . You were always so fond of children . ”
53768	53779	53781	53781	Valancy	107	“ But nine is such a family to start with , ”
53784	53873	53633	53633	she	107	“ The two oldest are grown up and the third almost . That leaves only six that really count . And most of them are boys . So much easier to bring up than girls . There ’s an excellent book—‘Health Care of the Growing Child’—Gladys has a copy , I think . It would be such a help to you . And there are books about morals . You ’d manage nicely . Of course I told Mr. Beck that I thought you would — would — — ”
53874	53879	53881	53881	Valancy	107	“ Jump at him , ”
53883	53923	53633	53633	she	107	“ Oh , no , no , dear . I would n’t use such an indelicate expression . I told him I thought you would consider his proposal favourably . And you will , wo n’t you , dearie ? ”
53924	53931	53933	53933	Valancy	107	“ There ’s only one obstacle , ”
53936	53945	53933	53933	Valancy	107	“ You see , I ’m married already . ”
53946	53949	53950	53951	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ Married ! ”
53961	53964	53959	53959	Valancy	107	“ Married ! ”
53965	53981	53633	53633	she	107	“ Yes . I was married to Barney Snaith last Tuesday evening in Port Lawrence . ”
54000	54019	53959	53959	Valancy	107	“ Doss , dear — I’m an old woman — are you trying to make fun of me ? ”
54020	54039	53959	53959	Valancy	107	“ Not at all . I ’m only telling you the truth . For heaven ’s sake , Cousin Georgiana,”—Valancy
54044	54053	53959	53959	Valancy	107	symptoms—“don’t go crying here on the public road ! ”
54069	54084	53959	53959	Valancy	107	“ Oh , Doss , what have you done ? What have you done ? ”
54085	54098	54100	54100	Valancy	107	“ I ’ve just been telling you . I ’ve got married , ”
54106	54131	53959	53959	Valancy	107	“ To that — that — aw — that — Barney Snaith . Why , they say he ’s had a dozen wives already . ”
54132	54142	54144	54144	Valancy	107	“ I ’m the only one round at present , ”
54146	54154	54156	54157	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ What will your poor mother say ? ”
54159	54173	54175	54175	Valancy	107	“ Come along with me and hear , if you want to know , ”
54177	54188	54175	54175	Valancy	107	“ I ’m on my way to tell her now . ”
54316	54326	54328	54329	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ To marry a man you know nothing about , ”
54332	54345	54347	54347	Valancy	107	“ I know more about him than I know of Edward Beck , ”
54349	54356	54358	54359	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ Edward Beck goes to church , ”
54361	54369	54358	54359	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ Does Bar — does your husband ? ”
54370	54384	54386	54386	Valancy	107	“ He has promised that he will go with me on fine Sundays , ”
54403	54415	54358	54359	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ Look at my rosebush ! Why , it ’s blooming ! ”
54436	54448	54450	54450	Valancy	107	“ My cutting it to pieces must have done it good , ”
54555	54558	54560	54560	Valancy	107	“ Beautiful , ”
54563	54564	54566	54566	she	175	“ but”—as
54573	54580	54566	54566	she	175	eyes—“without the slightest touch of distinction . ”
54674	54695	54667	54667	She	175	“ So you ’re back , Doss ? Very warm day , is n’t it ? Did you walk in ? ”
54696	54702	54667	54667	She	175	“ Yes . Coming in ? ”
54703	54786	54667	54667	She	175	“ Oh , no . I ’ve just been in . I ’ve come often to comfort poor Aunty . She ’s been so lonesome . I ’m going to Mrs. Bartlett ’s tea . I have to help pour . She ’s giving it for her cousin from Toronto . Such a charming girl . You ’d have loved meeting her , Doss . I think Mrs. Bartlett did send you a card . Perhaps you ’ll drop in later on . ”
54787	54796	54798	54798	Valancy	107	“ No , I do n’t think so , ”
54801	54826	54798	54798	Valancy	107	“ I ’ll have to be home to get Barney ’s supper . We ’re going for a moonlit canoe ride around Mistawis tonight . ”
54827	54832	54834	54834	Olive	175	“ Barney ? Supper ? ”
54836	54845	54834	54834	Olive	175	“ What do you mean , Valancy Stirling ? ”
54846	54856	54857	54857	Valancy	107	“ Valancy Snaith , by the grace of God . ”
55071	55081	55082	55083	Uncle Benjamin	108	answer—“one gets all the honey , the other all the whacks”—and
55222	55227	55228	55228	she	107	“ Well , Mother , ”
55232	55241	55243	55244	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ So you ’ve come home at last ! ”
55269	55275	55277	55277	Valancy	107	“ Well , not exactly , ”
55284	55307	55279	55279	She	107	“ I thought I ought to drop in and tell you I was married . Last Tuesday night . To Barney Snaith . ”
55317	55323	55324	55324	he	108	“ God bless my soul ! ”
55357	55368	55370	55370	Valancy	107	“ She would have to keep up the Victorian traditions , ”
55393	55407	55409	55409	Valancy	107	“ Is there one day in your life that you have n’t cried ? ”
55412	55415	55417	55418	Uncle James	107	“ Valancy , ”
55430	55440	55417	55418	Uncle James	107	“ did you mean what you said just now ? ”
55441	55445	55409	55409	Valancy	107	“ I did . ”
55446	55476	55417	55418	Uncle James	107	“ Do you mean to say that you have actually gone and married — married — that notorious Barney Snaith — that — that — criminal — that — — ”
55477	55481	55409	55409	Valancy	107	“ I have . ”
55482	55485	55487	55488	Uncle James	107	“ Then , ”
55491	55527	55487	55488	Uncle James	107	“ you are a shameless creature , lost to all sense of propriety and virtue , and I wash my hands entirely of you . I do not want ever to see your face again . ”
55528	55540	55542	55542	Valancy	107	“ What have you left to say when I commit murder ? ”
55555	55563	55544	55545	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ That drunken outlaw — that — — ”
55590	55601	55602	55602	she	107	“ Say ‘ damn ’ and you ’ll feel better , ”
55605	55632	55544	55545	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ I can express my feelings without blasphemy . And I tell you have covered yourself with eternal disgrace and infamy by marrying that drunkard — — ”
55633	55651	55577	55577	they	1547	“ You would be more endurable if you got drunk occasionally . Barney is not a drunkard . ”
55652	55666	55668	55669	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ He was seen drunk in Port Lawrence — pickled to the gills , ”
55671	55722	55577	55577	they	1547	“ If that is true — and I do n’t believe it — he had a good reason for it . Now I suggest that you all stop looking tragic and accept the situation . I ’m married — you ca n’t undo that . And I ’m perfectly happy . ”
55723	55737	55739	55740	Cousin Sarah	167	“ I suppose we ought to be thankful he has really married her , ”
55753	55759	55761	55762	Uncle James	107	“ If he really has , ”
55773	55778	55761	55762	Uncle James	107	“ Who married you ? ”
55779	55787	55826	55827	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Mr. Towers , of Port Lawrence . ”
55788	55794	55796	55797	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ By a Free Methodist ! ”
55863	55876	55878	55879	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ It makes me think of those what - d’ye - call-’ems , ”
55882	55898	55878	55879	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Those yarns — you know — of fairies taking babies out of their cradles . ”
55899	55911	55913	55914	Aunt Wellington	91	“ Valancy could hardly be a changeling at twenty - nine , ”
55917	55931	55933	55934	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ She was the oddest - looking baby I ever saw , anyway , ”
55936	55962	55933	55934	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ I said so at the time — you remember , Amelia ? I said I had never seen such eyes in a human head . ”
55963	55973	55975	55976	Cousin Sarah	167	“ I ’m glad I never had any children , ”
55978	55995	55975	55976	Cousin Sarah	167	“ If they do n’t break your heart in one way they do it in another . ”
55996	56013	56015	56015	Valancy	107	“ Is n’t it better to have your heart broken than to have it wither up ? ”
56017	56037	56015	56015	Valancy	107	“ Before it could be broken it must have felt something splendid . That would be worth the pain . ”
56038	56044	56046	56047	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Dippy — clean dippy , ”
56064	56067	56069	56070	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Valancy , ”
56073	56086	56069	56070	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ do you ever pray to be forgiven for disobeying your mother ? ”
56087	56100	56102	56102	Valancy	107	“ I should pray to be forgiven for obeying you so long , ”
56105	56126	56102	56102	Valancy	107	“ But I do n’t pray about that at all . I just thank God every day for my happiness . ”
56127	56132	56134	56135	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ I would rather , ”
56143	56159	56134	56135	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ see you dead before me than listen to what you have told me today . ”
56204	56218	56220	56221	Uncle James	107	“ Barney Snaith is a scoundrel to have deluded you into marrying him , ”
56224	56239	56241	56241	Valancy	107	“ Oh , I did the deluding . I asked him to marry me , ”
56248	56254	56256	56257	Aunt Wellington	91	“ Have you no pride ? ”
56259	56290	56220	56221	Uncle James	107	“ Lots of it . I am proud that I have achieved a husband by my own unaided efforts . Cousin Georgiana here wanted to help me to Edward Beck . ”
56291	56310	56312	56313	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Edward Beck is worth twenty thousand dollars and has the finest house between here and Port Lawrence , ”
56315	56321	56323	56323	Valancy	107	“ That sounds very fine , ”
56326	56332	56323	56323	Valancy	107	“ but it is n’t worth that“—she
56335	56349	56220	56221	Uncle James	107	fingers—“compared to feeling Barney ’s arms around me and his cheek against mine . ”
56350	56355	56357	56358	Cousin Stickles	97	“ Oh , Doss ! ”
56364	56369	56360	56361	Cousin Sarah	167	“ Oh , Doss ! ”
56374	56383	56370	56371	Aunt Wellington	91	“ Valancy , you need not be indecent . ”
56384	56416	56220	56221	Uncle James	107	“ Why , it surely is n’t indecent to like to have your husband put his arm around you ? I should think it would be indecent if you did n’t . ”
56417	56424	56426	56427	Uncle James	107	“ Why expect decency from her ? ”
56430	56452	56426	56427	Uncle James	107	“ She has cut herself off from decency forevermore . She has made her bed . Let her lie on it . ”
56453	56456	56458	56458	Valancy	107	“ Thanks , ”
56462	56494	56458	56458	Valancy	107	“ How you would have enjoyed being Torquemada ! Now , I must really be getting back . Mother , may I have those three woollen cushions I worked last winter ? ”
56495	56502	56504	56505	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Take them — take everything ! ”
56507	56544	56504	56505	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Oh , I do n’t want everything — or much . I do n’t want my Blue Castle cluttered . Just the cushions . I ’ll call for them some day when we motor in . ”
56578	56592	56593	56593	she	107	“ The trouble with you people is that you do n’t laugh enough , ”
56596	56601	56603	56604	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ Doss , dear , ”
56607	56620	56603	56604	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ some day you will discover that blood is thicker than water . ”
56621	56635	56637	56637	Valancy	107	“ Of course it is . But who wants water to be thick ? ”
56639	56653	56637	56637	Valancy	107	“ We want water to be thin — sparkling — crystal - clear . ”
56685	56703	56682	56682	she	107	“ Do you mind if I drop in and see you once in a while , Mother ? ”
56704	56714	56716	56717	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ My house will always be open to you , ”
56724	56732	56734	56735	Uncle James	107	“ You should never recognise her again , ”
56745	56757	56759	56760	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ I can not quite forget that I am a mother , ”
56762	56769	56759	56760	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ My poor , unfortunate girl ! ”
56770	56780	56782	56783	Uncle James	107	“ I dare say the marriage is n’t legal , ”
56786	56821	56822	56822	James	107	“ He has probably been married half a dozen times before . But I am through with her . I have done all I could , Amelia . I think you will admit that . Henceforth”—Uncle
56827	56835	56822	56822	James	107	it—“Valancy is to me as one dead . ”
56836	56841	56843	56844	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ Mrs. Barney Snaith , ”
56858	56869	56871	56872	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ He has a score of aliases , no doubt , ”
56874	56899	56871	56872	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ For my part , I believe the man is half Indian . I have n’t a doubt they ’re living in a wigwam . ”
56900	56928	56930	56931	Cousin Stickles	97	“ If he has married her under the name of Snaith and it is n’t his real name would n’t that make the marriage null and void ? ”
56940	56954	56937	56937	his	108	“ No , it is the man who marries , not the name . ”
56955	56959	56961	56962	Cousin Gladys	92	“ You know , ”
56974	57026	56961	56962	Cousin Gladys	92	“ I had a distinct premonition of this at Herbert ’s silver dinner . I remarked it at the time . When she was defending Snaith . You remember , of course . It came over me like a revelation . I spoke to David when I went home about it . ”
57027	57032	57034	57038	Aunt Wellington of the universe	1558	“ What — what , ”
57040	57048	57034	57038	Aunt Wellington of the universe	1558	“ has come over Valancy ? Valancy ! ”
57059	57104	56961	56962	Cousin Gladys	92	“ Is n’t there something coming up of late about secondary personalities cropping out ? I do n’t hold with many of those new - fangled notions , but there may be something in this one . It would account for her incomprehensible conduct . ”
57105	57113	57115	57116	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ Valancy is so fond of mushrooms , ”
57118	57137	57115	57116	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ I ’m afraid she ’ll get poisoned eating toadstools by mistake living up back in the woods . ”
57138	57146	57148	57149	Uncle James	107	“ There are worse things than death , ”
57169	57178	57180	57181	Cousin Stickles	97	“ Nothing can ever be the same again ! ”
57398	57405	57406	57406	he	108	“ I have made her happy , ”
57410	57424	57406	57406	he	108	“ and she was miserable with her friends . So that ’s that . ”
57446	57450	57436	57436	women	2354	“ made happy . ”
57451	57457	57458	57458	he	108	“ You — you pup ! ”
57461	57467	57469	57469	Barney	140	“ Why be so unoriginal ? ”
57472	57519	57469	57469	Barney	140	“ Anybody could call me a pup . Why not think of something worthy of the Stirlings ? Besides , I ’m not a pup . I ’m really quite a middle - aged dog . Thirty - five , if you ’re interested in knowing . ”
57654	57666	57668	57668	Barney	140	“ Peace , perfect peace , with loved ones far away , ”
57699	57709	57710	57710	she	110	“ For your spare - room bed , dear , ”
57713	57724	57726	57726	Valancy	107	“ But I have n’t got any spare - room , ”
57745	57753	57755	57755	Valancy	107	“ But it ’s a lovely spread , ”
57761	57791	57755	57755	Valancy	107	“ and I ’m so glad to have it . I ’ll put it on my own bed . Barney ’s old patch - work quilt is getting ragged . ”
57792	57807	57809	57810	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ I do n’t see how you can be contented to live up back , ”
57812	57821	57809	57810	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ It ’s so out of the world . ”
57822	57825	57826	57826	Valancy	107	“ Contented ! ”
57841	57845	57846	57846	she	110	“ It is , ”
57849	57859	57846	57846	she	110	“ most gloriously and entirely out of the world . ”
57860	57869	57871	57872	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ And you are really happy , dear ? ”
57875	57880	57882	57882	Valancy	107	“ I really am , ”
57889	57897	57899	57900	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ Marriage is such a serious thing , ”
57902	57911	57913	57913	Valancy	107	“ When it ’s going to last long , ”
57998	58001	57987	57987	Barney	140	“ up back ”
58810	58824	58825	58825	Barney	140	“ What a view old Tom picked out when he built this shack ! ”
58989	58993	58994	58994	he	1607	“ After all , ”
58997	59047	58994	58994	he	1607	“ there ’s something to be said for square meals . I ’ve mostly got along by boiling two or three dozen eggs hard at once and eating a few when I got hungry , with a slice of bacon once in a while and a jorum of tea . ”
59391	59402	59403	59403	Barney	140	“ Would you like a house like that , Moonlight ? ”
59426	59429	59431	59431	Valancy	107	“ No , ”
59450	59452	59413	59413	He	1627	“ cottage ”
59462	59545	59431	59431	Valancy	107	“ No . It ’s too elegant . I would have to carry it with me everywhere I went . On my back like a snail . It would own me — possess me , body and soul . I like a house I can love and cuddle and boss . Just like ours here . I do n’t envy Hamilton Gossard ‘ the finest summer residence in Canada . ’ It is magnificent , but it is n’t my Blue Castle . ”
59670	59684	59686	59686	Valancy	107	“ It was lovely — but I do n’t want to go again , ”
59894	59902	59903	59903	Barney	140	“ Have you missed me , Moonlight ? ”
59907	59918	59920	59920	Valancy	107	“ It seems a hundred years since you went away , ”
59922	59930	59903	59903	Barney	140	“ I wo n’t leave you again . ”
59931	59935	59937	59937	Valancy	107	“ You must , ”
59939	59972	59937	59937	Valancy	107	“ if you want to . I ’d be miserable if I thought you wanted to go and did n’t , because of me . I want you to feel perfectly free . ”
59980	59991	59992	59992	he	1651	“ There is no such thing as freedom on earth , ”
59995	60037	59992	59992	he	1651	“ Only different kinds of bondages . And comparative bondages . You think you are free now because you ’ve escaped from a peculiarly unbearable kind of bondage . But are you ? You love me — that ’s a bondage . ”
60038	60057	60059	60059	Valancy	107	“ Who said or wrote that ‘ the prison unto which we doom ourselves no prison is ’ ? ”
60074	60082	60084	60084	Barney	140	“ Ah , now you have it , ”
60086	60106	60084	60084	Barney	140	“ That ’s all the freedom we can hope for — the freedom to choose our prison . But , Moonlight,”—he
60136	60185	60084	60084	Barney	140	lights—“Moonlight , I ’m glad to be home again . When I came down through the woods and saw my home lights — mine — gleaming out under the old pines — something I ’d never seen before — oh , girl , I was glad — glad ! ”
60919	60937	60938	60938	Barney	140	“ We do n’t know where we ’re going , but is n’t it fun to go ? ”
61252	61407	61246	61246	Barney	140	“ Moonlight and blue twilight — that is what you look like in that dress . I like it . It belongs to you . You are n’t exactly pretty , but you have some adorable beauty - spots . Your eyes . And that little kissable dent just between your collar bones . You have the wrist and ankle of an aristocrat . That little head of yours is beautifully shaped . And when you look backward over your shoulder you ’re maddening — especially in twilight or moonlight . An elf maiden . A wood sprite . You belong to the woods , Moonlight — you should never be out of them . In spite of your ancestry , there is something wild and remote and untamed about you . And you have such a nice , sweet , throaty , summery voice . Such a nice voice for love - making . ”
61408	61418	61420	61420	Valancy	107	“ Shure an ’ ye’ve kissed the Blarney Stone , ”
61566	61578	61579	61579	she	107	“ I understand now what it means to be born again , ”
61587	61590	61583	61583	Holmes	269	“ staining backward ”
61635	61645	61647	61647	Valancy	107	“ When death comes , I shall have lived , ”
61649	61657	61647	61647	Valancy	107	“ I shall have had my hour . ”
61693	61699	61700	61700	Barney	140	“ What are you celebrating ? ”
61705	61714	61715	61715	Valancy	107	“ I ’m just exorcising an old demon , ”
61953	61959	61934	61976	those aggravating people who can never hear you smiling audibly over something you ’ve read without inquiring placidly , “ What is the joke ? ” October — with a gorgeous pageant of color around Mistawis , into which Valancy plunged her soul	1700	“ What is the joke ? ”
62243	62263	62265	62265	Barney	140	“ Warm fire — books — comfort — safety from storm — our cats on the rug . Moonlight , ”
62267	62281	62265	62265	Barney	140	“ would you be any happier now if you had a million dollars ? ”
62282	62300	62228	62228	they	1697	“ No — nor half so happy . I ’d be bored by conventions and obligations then . ”
62419	62421	62383	62384	Her mother	343	“ up back”—almost
62665	62675	62676	62676	he	1724	“ Bring no more of that devilish stuff here , ”
62816	62820	62822	62822	Barney	140	“ Come away , ”
62826	62838	62822	62822	Barney	140	“ We must not commit the desecration of tramping through there . ”
62995	63012	63014	63014	Barney	140	“ ‘ All the beauty that old Greece and Rome , sung painted , taught , ’ ”
63016	63032	63034	63034	Valancy	107	“ And to think no human eyes save ours have seen or will see it , ”
63091	63106	63108	63108	Valancy	107	“ ‘ All the tintings of winter woods are extremely delicate and elusive , ’ ”
63110	63297	63108	63108	Valancy	107	“ ‘ When the brief afternoon wanes and the sun just touches the tops of the hills , there seems to be all over the woods an abundance , not of colour , but of the spirit of colour . There is really nothing but pure white after all , but one has the impression of fairy - like blendings of rose and violet , opal and heliotrope on the slopes — in the dingles and along the curves of the forest - land . You feel sure the tint is there , but when you look at it directly it is gone . From the corner of your eye you are aware that it is lurking over yonder in a spot where there was nothing but pale purity a moment ago . Only just when the sun is setting is there a fleeting moment of real colour . Then the redness streams out over the snow and incarnadines the hills and rivers and smites the crest of the pines with flame . Just a few minutes of transfiguration and revelation — and it is gone . ’
63298	63311	63313	63313	Valancy	107	“ I wonder if John Foster ever spent a winter in Mistawis , ”
63315	63319	63321	63321	Barney	140	“ Not likely , ”
63323	63343	63321	63321	Barney	140	“ People who write tosh like that generally write it in a warm house on some smug city street . ”
63344	63353	63355	63355	Valancy	107	“ You are too hard on John Foster , ”
63358	63384	63355	63355	Valancy	107	“ No one could have written that little paragraph I read you last night without having seen it first — you know he could n’t . ”
63385	63393	63395	63395	Barney	140	“ I did n’t listen to it , ”
63398	63408	63395	63395	Barney	140	“ You know I told you I would n’t . ”
63409	63420	63422	63422	Valancy	107	“ Then you ’ve got to listen to it now , ”
63437	63452	63433	63433	she	107	“ ‘ She is a rare artist , this old Mother Nature , who works “
63458	63557	63424	63424	She	107	” and not in any spirit of vain show . Today the fir woods are a symphony of greens and greys , so subtle that you can not tell where one shade begins to be the other . Grey trunk , green bough , grey - green moss above the white , grey - shadowed floor . Yet the old gypsy does n’t like unrelieved monotones . She must have a dash of colour . See it . A broken dead fir bough , of a beautiful red - brown , swinging among the beards of moss . ’ ”
63558	63573	63580	63580	he	1736	“ Good Lord , do you learn all that fellow ’s books by heart ? ”
63584	63601	63603	63603	Valancy	107	“ John Foster ’s books were all that saved my soul alive the past five years , ”
63605	63628	63603	63603	Valancy	107	“ Oh , Barney , look at that exquisite filigree of snow in the furrows of that old elm - tree trunk . ”
63832	63845	63847	63847	Barney	140	“ Looks exactly like a picture - book , does n’t it ? ”
63903	63905	63920	63920	They	1748	“ reunions ”
63916	63919	63920	63920	They	1748	“ nerves . ”
63964	63979	63981	63981	Barney	140	“ A land that can produce a goose like that is an admirable land , ”
63983	63987	63981	63981	Barney	140	“ Canada forever ! ”
64011	64016	64017	64018	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ One never knows , ”
64023	64032	64017	64018	Cousin Georgiana	110	“ when one may need a little stimulant . ”
64045	64051	64053	64053	Valancy	107	“ Something frivolous and unnecessary , ”
64366	64375	64377	64377	Barney	140	“ But they ’ll come back in spring , ”
64528	64555	64557	64557	Barney	140	“ A plate of apples , an open fire , and ‘ a jolly goode booke whereon to looke ’ are a fair substitute for heaven , ”
64559	64577	64557	64557	Barney	140	“ Any one can have the streets of gold . Let ’s have another whack at Carman . ”
65126	65132	65133	65133	Barney	140	“ You do laugh beautifully , ”
65138	65190	65133	65133	Barney	140	“ It makes me want to laugh just to hear you laugh . There ’s a trick about your laugh — as if there were so much more fun back of it that you would n’t let out . Did you laugh like that before you came to Mistawis , Moonlight ? ”
65191	65221	65264	65265	a man	335	“ I never laughed at all — really . I used to giggle foolishly when I felt I was expected to . But now — the laugh just comes . ”
65808	65817	65818	65818	she	107	“ Barney , I thought you were dead , ”
65824	65891	65821	65821	Barney	140	“ After two years of the Klondike did you think a baby storm like this could get me ? I spent the night in that old lumber shanty over by Muskoka . A bit cold but snug enough . Little goose ! Your eyes look like burnt holes in a blanket . Did you sit up here all night worrying over an old woodsman like me ? ”
65892	65895	65897	65897	Valancy	107	“ Yes , ”
65899	65966	65897	65897	Valancy	107	“ I — couldn’t help it . The storm seemed so wild . Anybody might have been lost in it . When — I saw you — come round the point — there — something happened to me . I do n’t know what . It was as if I had died and come back to life . I ca n’t describe it any other way . ”
66115	66134	66136	66136	Valancy	107	“ Think how many thousands of springs have been here on Mistawis — and all of them beautiful , ”
66138	66189	66136	66136	Valancy	107	“ Oh , Barney , look at that wild plum ! I will — I must quote from John Foster . There ’s a passage in one of his books — I’ve re - read it a hundred times . He must have written it before a tree just like that :
66190	66325	66493	66493	Valancy	107	“ ‘ Behold the young wild plum - tree which has adorned herself after immemorial fashion in a wedding - veil of fine lace . The fingers of wood pixies must have woven it , for nothing like it ever came from an earthly loom . I vow the tree is conscious of its loveliness . It is bridling before our very eyes — as if its beauty were not the most ephemeral thing in the woods , as it is the rarest and most exceeding , for today it is and tomorrow it is not . Every south wind purring through the boughs will winnow away a shower of slender petals . But what matter ? Today it is queen of the wild places and it is always today in the woods . ’ ”
66326	66344	66346	66346	Barney	140	“ I ’m sure you feel much better since you ’ve got that out of your system , ”
66349	66357	66359	66359	Valancy	107	“ Here ’s a patch of dandelions , ”
66363	66412	66359	66359	Valancy	107	“ Dandelions should n’t grow in the woods , though . They have n’t any sense of the fitness of things at all . They are too cheerful and self - satisfied . They have n’t any of the mystery and reserve of the real wood - flowers . ”
66413	66422	66424	66424	Barney	140	“ In short , they ’ve no secrets , ”
66426	66484	66424	66424	Barney	140	“ But wait a bit . The woods will have their own way even with those obvious dandelions . In a little while all that obtrusive yellowness and complacency will be gone and we ’ll find here misty , phantom - like globes hovering over those long grasses in full harmony with the traditions of the forest . ”
66485	66491	66493	66493	Valancy	107	“ That sounds John Fosterish , ”
66495	66507	66509	66509	Barney	140	“ What have I done that deserved a slam like that ? ”
67030	67037	67039	67039	Barney	140	“ I ’ve had a caller , ”
67053	67056	67057	67057	Valancy	107	“ Who ? ”
67071	67083	67063	67063	She	107	“ Allan Tierney . He wants to paint you , Moonlight . ”
67084	67087	67088	67088	Valancy	107	“ Me ! ”
67096	67105	67088	67088	Valancy	107	“ You ’re laughing at me , Barney . ”
67106	67138	67063	67063	She	107	“ I ’m not . That ’s what Tierney came for . To ask my permission to paint my wife — as the Spirit of Muskoka , or something like that . ”
67139	67144	67146	67146	Valancy	107	“ But — but — ”
67148	67160	67146	67146	Valancy	107	“ Allan Tierney never paints any but — any but — — ”
67161	67165	67167	67167	Barney	140	“ Beautiful women , ”
67169	67184	67167	67167	Barney	140	“ Conceded . Q. E. D. , Mistress Barney Snaith is a beautiful woman . ”
67185	67188	67190	67190	Valancy	107	“ Nonsense , ”
67198	67229	67190	67190	Valancy	107	“ You know that ’s nonsense , Barney . I know I ’m a heap better - looking than I was a year ago , but I ’m not beautiful . ”
67230	67238	67240	67240	Barney	140	“ Allan Tierney never makes a mistake , ”
67242	67420	67240	67240	Barney	140	“ You forget , Moonlight , that there are different kinds of beauty . Your imagination is obsessed by the very obvious type of your cousin Olive . Oh , I ’ve seen her — she ’s a stunner — but you ’d never catch Allan Tierney wanting to paint her . In the horrible but expressive slang phrase , she keeps all her goods in the shop - window . But in your subconscious mind you have a conviction that nobody can be beautiful who does n’t look like Olive . Also , you remember your face as it was in the days when your soul was not allowed to shine through it . Tierney said something about the curve of your cheek as you looked back over your shoulder . You know I ’ve often told you it was distracting . And he ’s quite batty about your eyes . If I was n’t absolutely sure it was solely professional — he ’s really a crabbed old bachelor , you know — I’d be jealous . ”
67421	67432	67434	67434	Valancy	107	“ Well , I do n’t want to be painted , ”
67436	67444	67434	67434	Valancy	107	“ I hope you told him that . ”
67445	67546	67240	67240	Barney	140	“ I could n’t tell him that . I did n’t know what you wanted . But I told him I did n’t want my wife painted — hung up in a salon for the mob to stare at . Belonging to another man . For of course I could n’t buy the picture . So even if you had wanted to be painted , Moonlight , your tyrannous husband would not have permitted it . Tierney was a bit squiffy . He is n’t used to being turned down like that . His requests are almost like royalty ’s . ”
67547	67553	67555	67555	Valancy	107	“ But we are outlaws , ”
67557	67569	67555	67555	Valancy	107	“ We bow to no decrees — we acknowledge no sovereignty . ”
67577	67607	67555	67555	Valancy	107	“ I wish Olive could know that Allan Tierney wanted to paint me . Me ! Little - old - maid - Valancy - Stirling - that - was . ”
67751	67754	67759	67759	she	1828	“ passing away ”
67898	67904	67906	67906	Barney	140	“ You nice little thing , ”
67909	67935	67906	67906	Barney	140	“ Oh , you nice little thing ! Sometimes I feel you ’re too nice to be real — that I ’m just dreaming you . ”
67936	67954	67956	67956	Valancy	107	“ Why ca n’t I die now — this very minute — when I am so happy ! ”
68119	68133	68135	68135	Valancy	107	“ I ’m afraid heaven will be very dull after this past year , ”
68137	68194	68135	68135	Valancy	107	“ But perhaps one will not remember . Would that be — nice ? No , no . I do n’t want to forget Barney . I ’d rather be miserable in heaven remembering him than happy forgetting him . And I ’ll always remember through all eternity — that he really , really liked me . ”
68712	68717	68718	68718	she	107	“ Barney — Barney ! ”
68775	68788	68790	68790	Valancy	107	“ Go — go — quick — you’ll be killed , Barney ! ”
68869	68883	68860	68860	She	107	“ Barney — go — go — for God ’s sake — go ! ”
68884	68887	68889	68889	Barney	140	“ Never ! ”
68948	68952	68953	68953	he	1858	“ Thank God ! ”
69396	69421	69383	69383	He	1877	“ I suppose we ’d better be hiking back . Sun ’s getting low . Are you good for the rest of the road ? ”
69422	69427	69429	69429	Valancy	107	“ I think so , ”
69665	69668	69690	69690	him	1877	“ Yes . ”
69669	69672	69673	69673	she	107	“ No , ”
70341	70348	70387	70388	Dr. Trent	92	“ Er — Miss — Miss — ”
70349	70353	70355	70355	Valancy	107	“ Mrs. Snaith , ”
70358	70386	70355	70355	Valancy	107	“ I was Miss Valancy Stirling when I came to you last May — over a year ago . I wanted to consult you about my heart . ”
70393	70494	70387	70388	Dr. Trent	92	“ Oh , of course . I remember now . I ’m really not to blame for not knowing you . You ’ve changed — splendidly . And married . Well , well , it has agreed with you . You do n’t look much like an invalid now , hey ? I remember that day . I was badly upset . Hearing about poor Ned bowled me over . But Ned ’s as good as new and you , too , evidently . I told you so , you know — told you there was nothing to worry over . ”
70500	70509	70510	70510	she	107	“ You told me , in your letter , ”
70528	70562	70519	70521	some one else	1910	“ that I had angina pectoris — in the last stages — complicated with an aneurism . That I might die any minute — that I could n’t live longer than a year . ”
70569	70572	70573	70573	he	92	“ Impossible ! ”
70577	70586	70573	70573	he	92	“ I could n’t have told you that ! ”
70600	70605	70606	70606	he	92	“ Miss Valancy Stirling , ”
70609	70637	70606	70606	he	92	“ Yes — yes . Of course I wrote you — on the train — that night . But I told you there was nothing serious — — ”
70638	70643	70645	70645	Valancy	107	“ Read your letter , ”
70680	70749	70668	70668	He	92	“ Good heavens ! This is the letter I meant for old Miss Jane Sterling . From Port Lawrence . She was here that day , too . I sent you the wrong letter . What unpardonable carelessness ! But I was beside myself that night . My God , and you believed that — you believed — but you didn’t — you went to another doctor — — ”
70766	70771	70772	70772	she	107	“ I believed it , ”
70776	70808	70772	70772	she	107	“ I did n’t go to any other doctor . I — I — it would take too long to explain . But I believed I was going to die soon . ”
70815	70841	70809	70810	Dr. Trent	92	“ I can never forgive myself . What a year you must have had ! But you do n’t look — I ca n’t understand ! ”
70842	70846	70848	70848	Valancy	107	“ Never mind , ”
70851	70863	70848	70848	Valancy	107	“ And so there ’s nothing the matter with my heart ? ”
70864	70907	70809	70810	Dr. Trent	92	“ Well , nothing serious . You had what is called pseudo - angina . It ’s never fatal — passes away completely with proper treatment . Or sometimes with a shock of joy . Have you been troubled much with it ? ”
70908	70915	70917	70917	Valancy	107	“ Not at all since March , ”
70944	70948	70809	70810	Dr. Trent	92	“ shock of joy ”
70952	70993	70809	70810	Dr. Trent	92	“ Then likely you ’re all right . I told you what to do in the letter you should have got . And of course I supposed you ’d go to another doctor . Child , why did n’t you ? ”
70994	71003	70809	70810	Dr. Trent	92	“ I did n’t want anybody to know . ”
71004	71007	71009	71010	Dr. Trent	92	“ Idiot , ”
71013	71207	71009	71010	Dr. Trent	92	“ I ca n’t understand such folly . And poor old Miss Sterling . She must have got your letter — telling her there was nothing serious the matter . Well , well , it could n’t have made any difference . Her case was hopeless . Nothing that she could have done or left undone could have made any difference . I was surprised she lived as long as she did — two months . She was here that day — not long before you . I hated to tell her the truth . You think I ’m a blunt old curmudgeon — and my letters are blunt enough . I ca n’t soften things . But I ’m a snivelling coward when it comes to telling a woman face to face that she ’s got to die soon . I told her I ’d look up some features of the case I was n’t quite sure of and let her know next day . But you got her letter — look here , ‘ Dear Miss S - t - e - r - l - i - n - g. ’ ”
71208	71234	71350	71351	Dr. Trent	92	“ Yes . I noticed that . But I thought it a mistake . I did n’t know there were any Sterlings in Port Lawrence . ”
71235	71332	71009	71010	Dr. Trent	92	“ She was the only one . A lonely old soul . Lived by herself with only a little home girl . She died two months after she was here — died in her sleep . My mistake could n’t have made any difference to her . But you ! I ca n’t forgive myself for inflicting a year ’s misery on you . It ’s time I retired , all right , when I do things like that — even if my son was supposed to be fatally injured . Can you ever forgive me ? ”
71533	71537	71525	71525	Snaith	140	“ up back ! ”
71746	71749	71778	71780	One of them	1933	“ up back ”
71793	71836	71784	71804	young people who whirled past her singing uproariously : “ My wife has the fever , O then , My wife	2929	“ My wife has the fever , O then , My wife has the fever , O then , My wife has the fever , Oh , I hope it wo n’t leave her , For I want to be single again . ”
72305	72319	72297	72297	Valancy	107	“ Such a face should have a fringe of white whisker around it . ”
72441	72470	72417	72417	he	1951	“ Can you tell me , Miss , if that house yonder belongs to a Mr. Redfern ? And if so , how can I get to it ? ”
72535	72538	72540	72540	Valancy	107	“ No , ”
72543	72553	72540	72540	Valancy	107	“ No — that house belongs to Mr. Snaith . ”
72558	72676	72554	72555	Dr. Redfern	119	“ Yes , I understand Bernie ’s been calling himself Snaith . Well , it ’s his middle name — was his poor mother ’s . Bernard Snaith Redfern — that ’s him . And now , Miss , you can tell me how to get over to that island ? Nobody seems to be home there . I ’ve done some waving and yelling . Henry , there , would n’t yell . He ’s a one - job man . But old Doc Redfern can yell with the best of them yet , and ai n’t above doing it . Raised nothing but a couple of crows . Guess Bernie ’s out for the day . ”
72677	72687	72689	72689	Valancy	107	“ He was away when I left this morning , ”
72691	72701	72689	72689	Valancy	107	“ I suppose he has n’t come home yet . ”
72749	72757	72737	72740	the aforesaid little imp	1952	“ It never rains but it pours . ”
72780	72794	72795	72795	He	119	“ When you left this morning ? Do you live — over there ? ”
72804	72808	72810	72810	Valancy	107	“ Of course , ”
72813	72819	72810	72810	Valancy	107	“ I ’m his wife . ”
72848	72870	72843	72845	Valancy ’s imp	1954	“ Why be bald ? Why lose your manly beauty ? Try Redfern ’s Hair Vigor . It keeps you young . ”
72871	72875	72877	72878	Dr. Redfern	119	“ Excuse me , ”
72880	72889	72877	72878	Dr. Redfern	119	“ This is a bit of a shock . ”
72890	72901	72902	72903	The imp	1955	“ Shocks seem to be in the air this morning . ”
72914	72939	72877	72878	Dr. Redfern	119	“ I did n’t know Bernie was — married . I did n’t think he would have got married without telling his old dad . ”
72968	72974	72975	72975	she	107	“ Do n’t blame him , ”
72979	72995	72975	72975	she	107	“ It — it was n’t his fault . It — was all my doing . ”
72996	73009	73011	73012	Dr. Redfern	119	“ You did n’t ask him to marry you , I suppose , ”
73014	73129	73011	73012	Dr. Redfern	119	“ He might have let me know . I ’d have got acquainted with my daughter - in - law before this if he had . But I ’m glad to meet you now , my dear — very glad . You look like a sensible young woman . I used to sorter fear Barney’d pick out some pretty bit of fluff just because she was good - looking . They were all after him , of course . Wanted his money ? Eh ? Did n’t like the pills and the bitters but liked the dollars . Eh ? Wanted to dip their pretty little fingers in old Doc ’s millions . Eh ? ”
73130	73133	73135	73135	Valancy	107	“ Millions ! ”
73177	73180	73182	73183	Dr. Redfern	119	“ Millions , ”
73186	73195	73197	73197	he	119	“ And Bernie chucks them for — that . ”
73207	73288	73197	73197	he	119	“ Would n’t you think he ’d have more sense ? And all on account of a white bit of a girl . He must have got over that feeling , anyhow , since he ’s married . You must persuade him to come back to civilisation . All nonsense wasting his life like this . Ai n’t you going to take me over to your house , my dear ? I suppose you ’ve some way of getting there . ”
73289	73293	73295	73295	Valancy	107	“ Of course , ”
73315	73327	73298	73298	She	107	“ Does your — your man want to come , too ? ”
73328	73382	73298	73298	She	107	“ Who ? Henry . Not he . Look at him sitting there disapproving . Disapproves of the whole expedition . The trail up from the road nearly gave him a conniption . Well , it was a devilish road to put a car on . Whose old bus is that up there ? ”
73383	73387	73298	73298	She	107	“ Barney ’s . ”
73388	73418	73298	73298	She	107	“ Good Lord ! Does Bernie Redfern ride in a thing like that ? It looks like the great - great - grand - mother of all the Fords . ”
73419	73432	73434	73434	Valancy	107	“ It is n’t a Ford . It ’s a Grey Slosson , ”
73593	73616	73577	73578	The doctor	2251	“ Warm , eh ? Lord , what a view ! Wonder if it would soften Henry if he could see it . ”
73617	73623	73625	73625	Valancy	107	“ Have you had dinner ? ”
73627	73727	73577	73578	The doctor	2251	“ Yes , my dear — had it before we left Port Lawrence . Did n’t know what sort of wild hermit ’s hollow we were coming to , you see . Had n’t any idea I was going to find a nice little daughter - in - law here all ready to toss me up a meal . Cats , eh ? Puss , puss ! See that . Cats love me . Bernie was always fond of cats ! It ’s about the only thing he took from me . He ’s his poor mother ’s boy . ”
73758	73816	73749	73750	Dr. Redfern	119	“ Sit down , dear . Never stand when you can sit . I want to get a good look at Barney ’s wife . Well , well , I like your face . No beauty — you do n’t mind my saying that — you’ve sense enough to know it , I reckon . Sit down . ”
73878	73888	73867	73868	Dr. Redfern	119	“ When do you think Bernie will be back ? ”
73889	73900	73867	73868	Dr. Redfern	119	“ I do n’t know — not before night probably . ”
73901	73907	73867	73868	Dr. Redfern	119	“ Where did he go ? ”
73908	73924	73867	73868	Dr. Redfern	119	“ I do n’t know that either . Likely to the woods — up back . ”
73925	73989	73867	73868	Dr. Redfern	119	“ So he does n’t tell you his comings and goings , either ? Bernie was always a secretive young devil . Never understood him . Just like his poor mother . But I thought a lot of him . It hurt me when he disappeared as he did . Eleven years ago . I have n’t seen my boy for eleven years . ”
73990	73994	73867	73868	Dr. Redfern	119	“ Eleven years . ”
73999	74009	73995	73995	Valancy	107	“ It ’s only six since he came here . ”
74010	74067	73867	73868	Dr. Redfern	119	“ Oh , he was in the Klondike before that — and all over the world . He used to drop me a line now and then — never give any clue to where he was but just a line to say he was all right . I s’pose he ’s told you all about it . ”
74068	74079	74081	74081	Valancy	107	“ No . I know nothing of his past life , ”
74139	74156	74504	74504	Mistawis	27	“ What happened ? Why did he leave his home ? Tell me . Tell me . ”
74157	74486	74523	74523	she	107	“ Well , it ai n’t much of a story . Just a young fool gone mad because of a quarrel with his girl . Only Bernie was a stubborn fool . Always stubborn . You never could make that boy do anything he did n’t want to do . From the day he was born . Yet he was always a quiet , gentle little chap , too . Good as gold . His poor mother died when he was only two years old . I ’d just begun to make money with my Hair Vigor . I ’d dreamed the formula for it , you see . Some dream that . The cash rolled in . Bernie had everything he wanted . I sent him to the best schools — private schools . I meant to make a gentleman of him . Never had any chance myself . Meant he should have every chance . He went through McGill . Got honours and all that . I wanted him to go in for law . He hankered after journalism and stuff like that . Wanted me to buy a paper for him — or back him in publishing what he called a ‘ real , worthwhile , honest - to - goodness Canadian Magazine . ’ I s’pose I ’d have done it — I always did what he wanted me to do . Was n’t he all I had to live for ? I wanted him to be happy . And he never was happy . Can you believe it ? Not that he said so . But I ’d always a feeling that he was n’t happy . Everything he wanted — all the money he could spend — his own bank account — travel — seeing the world — but he was n’t happy . Not till he fell in love with Ethel Traverse . Then he was happy for a little while . ”
74519	74522	74523	74523	she	107	“ Yes , ”
74540	74549	74523	74523	she	107	“ What — was — she — like ? ”
74550	74556	74558	74559	Dr. Redfern	119	“ Prettiest girl in Montreal , ”
74561	74663	74558	74559	Dr. Redfern	119	“ Oh , she was a looker , all right . Eh ? Gold hair — shiny as silk — great , big , soft , black eyes — skin like milk and roses . Do n’t wonder Bernie fell for her . And brains as well . She was n’t a bit of fluff . B. A. from McGill . A thoroughbred , too . One of the best families . But a bit lean in the purse . Eh ! Bernie was mad about her . Happiest young fool you ever saw . Then — the bust - up . ”
74664	74668	74669	74669	Valancy	107	“ What happened ? ”
74783	74938	75032	75032	herself	107	“ Blest if I know , my dear . Some fool quarrel , I suppose . Bernie just lit out — disappeared . He wrote me from the Yukon . Said his engagement was broken and he was n’t coming back . And not to try to hunt him up because he was never coming back . I did n’t . What was the use ? I knew Bernie . I went on piling , up money because there was n’t anything else to do . But I was mighty lonely . All I lived for was them little notes now and then from Bernie — Klondike — England — South Africa — China — everywhere . I thought maybe he ’d come back some day to his lonesome old dad . Then six years ago even the letters stopped . I did n’t hear a word of or from him till last Christmas . ”
74939	74944	75032	75032	herself	107	“ Did he write ? ”
74945	75024	75032	75032	herself	107	“ No . But he drew a check for fifteen thousand dollars on his bank account . The bank manager is a friend of mine — one of my biggest shareholders . He ’d always promised me he ’d let me know if Bernie drew any checks . Bernie had fifty thousand there . And he ’d never touched a cent of it till last Christmas . The check was made out to Aynsley ’s , Toronto — — ”
75025	75029	75032	75032	herself	107	“ Aynsley ’s ? ”
75051	75248	75037	75037	She	107	“ Yes . The big jewellery house there . After I ’d thought it over a while , I got brisk . I wanted to locate Bernie . Had a special reason for it . It was time he gave up his fool hoboing and come to his senses . Drawing that fifteen told me there was something in the wind . The manager communicated with the Aynsleys — his wife was an Aynsley — and found out that Bernard Redfern had bought a pearl necklace there . His address was given as Box 444 , Port Lawrence , Muskoka , Ont . First I thought I ’d write . Then I thought I ’d wait till the open season for cars and come down myself . Ai n’t no hand at writing . I ’ve motored from Montreal . Got to Port Lawrence yesterday . Enquired at the post - office . Told me they knew nothing of any Bernard Snaith Redfern , but there was a Barney Snaith had a P. O. box there . Lived on an island out here , they said . So here I am . And where ’s Barney ? ”
75292	75302	75305	75305	Valancy	107	“ Excuse me . It ’s so — amusing , ”
75307	75312	75314	75315	Dr. Redfern	119	“ Is n’t it ? ”
75326	75396	75314	75315	Dr. Redfern	119	“ Now , you seem like a sensible young woman , and I dare say you ’ve lots of influence over Bernie . Ca n’t you get him to come back to civilisation and live like other people ? I ’ve a house up there . Big as a castle . Furnished like a palace . I want company in it — Bernie ’s wife — Bernie ’s children . ”
75397	75404	75406	75406	Valancy	107	“ Did Ethel Traverse ever marry ? ”
75409	75498	75314	75315	Dr. Redfern	119	“ Bless you , yes . Two years after Bernie levanted . But she ’s a widow now . Pretty as ever . To be frank , that was my special reason for wanting to find Bernie . I thought they ’d make it up , maybe . But , of course , that ’s all off now . Does n’t matter . Bernie ’s choice of a wife is good enough for me . It ’s my boy I want . Think he ’ll soon be back ? ”
75499	75542	75627	75627	He	1973	“ I do n’t know . But I do n’t think he ’ll come before night . Quite late , perhaps . And perhaps not till tomorrow . But I can put you up comfortably . He ’ll certainly be back tomorrow . ”

75588	75626	75627	75627	He	1973	“ I must get back to Port Lawrence before rain starts . Henry goes quite mad when he gets mud on the car . But I ’ll come back tomorrow . Meanwhile you talk Bernie into reason . ”
75858	75863	75864	75864	she	107	“ At any rate , ”

77978	78063	77970	77970	She	107	“ A year ago Dr. Trent told me I had angina pectoris and could not live long . I wanted to have some — life — before I died . That ’s why I went away . Why I married Barney . And now I ’ve found it is all a mistake . There is nothing wrong with my heart . I ’ve got to live — and Barney only married me out of pity . So I have to leave him — free . ”

78109	78168	78106	78106	Valancy	107	“ What ’s the use of going into that now ? I ca n’t undo this year . God knows I wish I could . I ’ve tricked Barney into marrying me — and he ’s really Bernard Redfern . Dr. Redfern ’s son , of Montreal . And his father wants him to go back to him . ”
78207	78217	78218	78218	she	97	“ Dr. Redfern — not the Purple Pill man ? ”

78360	78375	78421	78422	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Did he say so ? Does he want to get rid of you ? ”

78515	78529	78531	78531	Valancy	107	“ You think Barney can easily get a divorce , do n’t you ? ”
78554	78587	78421	78422	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Trust to me , Valancy . Everything will arrange itself . Tell me this , Dossie . Have you been happy up back ? Was Sr.—Mr . Redfern good to you ? ”
78588	78602	78604	78604	Valancy	107	“ I have been very happy and Barney was very good to me , ”
78636	78639	78629	78629	They	2034	“ I have been”—it
78647	78656	78659	78661	paternal Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Then do n’t worry , little girl . ”
78664	78680	78659	78661	paternal Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Your family will stand behind you . We ’ll see what can be done . ”
78681	78685	78687	78687	Valancy	107	“ Thank you , ”
78700	78717	78697	78698	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Can I go and lie down a little while ? I’m — I’m — tired . ”
78718	78725	78726	78727	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Of course you ’re tired . ”
78736	78769	78726	78727	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ All worn out and nervous . Go and lie down , by all means . You ’ll see things in quite a different light after you ’ve had a good sleep . ”
78783	78796	78780	78780	he	108	“ What is the best way to keep a man ’s love ? ”
78815	78818	78819	78819	she	107	“ What ? ”
78827	78833	78835	78836	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Not to return it , ”
78858	78863	78864	78864	he	108	“ Poor little Doss ! ”
78868	78885	78887	78888	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Do you really suppose that — Snaith — can actually be Dr. Redfern ’s son ? ”
78890	78967	78887	78888	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ I see no reason for doubting it . She says Dr. Redfern has been there . Why , the man is rich as wedding - cake . Amelia , I ’ve always believed there was more in Doss than most people thought . You kept her down too much — repressed her . She never had a chance to show what was in her . And now she ’s landed a millionaire for a husband . ”
78968	78971	78973	78974	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ But — ”
78976	78988	78973	78974	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ he — he — they told terrible tales about him . ”
78989	79091	78887	78888	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ All gossip and invention — all gossip and invention . It ’s always been a mystery to me why people should be so ready to invent and circulate slanders about other people they know absolutely nothing about . I ca n’t understand why you paid so much attention to gossip and surmise . Just because he did n’t choose to mix up with everybody , people resented it . I was surprised to find what a decent fellow he seemed to be that time he came into my store with Valancy . I discounted all the yarns then and there . ”
79092	79104	79106	79107	Cousin Stickles	97	“ But he was seen dead drunk in Port Lawrence once , ”
79123	79128	79130	79131	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Who saw him ? ”
79134	79199	79130	79131	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Who saw him ? Old Jemmy Strang said he saw him . I would n’t take old Jemmy Strang ’s word on oath . He ’s too drunk himself half the time to see straight . He said he saw him lying drunk on a bench in the Park . Pshaw ! Redfern ’s been asleep there . Do n’t worry over that . ”
79200	79211	79213	79214	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ But his clothes — and that awful old car — ”
79217	79222	79224	79225	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Eccentricities of genius , ”
79227	79269	79224	79225	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ You heard Doss say he was John Foster . I ’m not up in literature myself , but I heard a lecturer from Toronto say that John Foster ’s books had put Canada on the literary map of the world . ”
79270	79280	79282	79283	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ I — suppose — we must forgive her , ”
79285	79289	79290	79291	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Forgive her ! ”
79317	79339	79305	79306	poor Doss	106	“ Well , yes , I think you ’d better forgive her ! The question is — will Snaith forgive us ! ”
79340	79359	79361	79362	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ What if she persists in leaving him ? You ’ve no idea how stubborn she can be , ”
79364	79600	79361	79362	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Leave it all to me , Amelia . Leave it all to me . You women have muddled it enough . This whole affair has been bungled from start to finish . If you had put yourself to a little trouble years ago , Amelia , she would not have bolted over the traces as she did . Just let her alone — don’t worry her with advice or questions till she ’s ready to talk . She ’s evidently run away in a panic because she ’s afraid he ’d be angry with her for fooling him . Most extraordinary thing of Trent to tell her such a yarn ! That ’s what comes of going to strange doctors . Well , well , we must n’t blame her too harshly , poor child . Redfern will come after her . If he does n’t , I ’ll hunt him up and talk to him as man to man . He may be a millionaire , but Valancy is a Stirling . He ca n’t repudiate her just because she was mistaken about her heart disease . Not likely he ’ll want to . Doss is a little overstrung . Bless me , I must get in the habit of calling her Valancy . She is n’t a baby any longer . Now , remember , Amelia . Be very kind and sympathetic . ”
80078	80095	80071	80071	She	107	“ Let me remember every one , God ! Let me never forget one of them ! ”
80210	80215	80206	80206	Barney	140	“ I love you , ”
80227	80231	80224	80224	Barney	140	“ I love you ”
80263	80279	80281	80281	Valancy	306	“ She can never have those hours in the Blue Castle . They are mine , ”
80462	80471	80473	80473	Valancy	306	“ Oh , why ca n’t I die ? ”
80555	80559	80546	80546	he	108	“ just dropped in ”
80641	80651	80653	80654	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Very good . Redfern will be here today , ”
80675	80681	80682	80682	he	108	“ Is my wife here ? ”
80695	80726	80690	80691	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Mr. Redfern , I believe ? Very glad to meet you , sir . Yes , that naughty little girl of yours is here . We have been — — ”
80727	80733	80734	80734	Barney	140	“ I must see her , ”
80741	80760	80761	80761	He	108	“ Certainly , Mr. Redfern . Just step in here . Valancy will be down in a minute . ”
80779	80794	80761	80761	He	108	“ Go up and tell Valancy to come down . Her husband is here . ”
80833	80837	80839	80840	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Valancy dear , ”
80843	80855	80839	80840	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ your husband is in the parlour , asking for you . ”
80856	80861	80862	80862	Valancy	307	“ Oh , Mother . ”
80873	80902	80870	80870	her	2082	“ I can not see him — I can not ! Tell him to go away — ask him to go away . I ca n’t see him ! ”
80903	80907	80909	80910	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Tell her , ”
80915	80930	80909	80910	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ that Redfern says he wo n’t go away until he has seen her . ”
81012	81020	81005	81005	he	108	“ Why are good husbands like bread ? ”
81026	81032	81034	81035	Uncle Benjamin	108	“ Because women need them , ”
81096	81186	81084	81084	Barney	140	“ Valancy , darling — oh , you darling little idiot ! Whatever possessed you to run away like that ? When I came home last night and found your letter I went quite mad . It was twelve o’clock — I knew it was too late to come here then . I walked the floor all night . Then this morning Dad came — I could n’t get away till now . Valancy , whatever got into you ? Divorce , forsooth ! Do n’t you know — — ”
81187	81198	81200	81200	Valancy	307	“ I know you only married me out of pity , ”
81207	81220	81200	81200	Valancy	307	“ I know you do n’t love me — I know — — ”
81221	81233	81235	81235	Barney	140	“ You ’ve been lying awake at three o’clock too long , ”
81240	81283	81235	81235	Barney	140	“ That ’s all that ’s the matter with you . Love you ! Oh , do n’t I love you ! My girl , when I saw that train coming down on you I knew whether I loved you or not ! ”
81284	81300	81302	81302	Valancy	307	“ Oh , I was afraid you would try to make me think you cared , ”
81305	81343	81302	81302	Valancy	307	“ Don’t — don’t ! I know . I know all about Ethel Traverse — your father told me everything . Oh , Barney , do n’t torture me ! I can never go back to you ! ”
81371	81374	81375	81375	he	2093	“ Valancy , ”
81379	81403	81375	81375	he	2093	“ Father could n’t have told you everything because he did n’t know it . Will you let me tell you — everything ? ”
81404	81407	81409	81409	Valancy	307	“ Yes , ”
81549	81582	81540	81540	she	2092	“ You ’ve seen Dad and you know I ’m Bernard Redfern . And I suppose you ’ve guessed that I ’m John Foster — since you went into Bluebeard ’s Chamber . ”
81583	81611	81540	81540	she	2092	“ Yes . But I did n’t go in out of curiosity . I forgot you had told me not to go in — I forgot — — ”
81612	81699	81540	81540	she	2092	“ Never mind . I ’m not going to kill you and hang you up on the wall , so there ’s no need to call for Sister Anne . I ’m only going to tell you my story from the beginning . I came back last night intending to do it . Yes , I ’m ‘ old Doc . Redfern ’s son’—of Purple Pills and Bitters fame . Oh , do n’t I know it ? Was n’t it rubbed into me for years ? ”
81749	82115	81742	81742	himself	140	“ Yes . As long as I can remember I ’ve been a millionaire ’s son . But when I was born Dad was n’t a millionaire . He was n’t even a doctor — isn’t yet . He was a veterinary and a failure at it . He and Mother lived in a little village up in Quebec and were abominably poor . I do n’t remember Mother . Have n’t even a picture of her . She died when I was two years old . She was fifteen years younger than Father — a little school teacher . When she died Dad moved into Montreal and formed a company to sell his hair tonic . He ’d dreamed the prescription one night , it seems . Well , it caught on . Money began to flow in . Dad invented — or dreamed — the other things , too — Pills , Bitters , Liniment and so on . He was a millionaire by the time I was ten , with a house so big a small chap like myself always felt lost in it . I had every toy a boy could wish for — and I was the loneliest little devil in the world . I remember only one happy day in my childhood , Valancy . Only one . Even you were better off than that . Dad had gone out to see an old friend in the country and took me along . I was turned loose in the barnyard and I spent the whole day hammering nails in a block of wood . I had a glorious day . When I had to go back to my roomful of playthings in the big house in Montreal I cried . But I did n’t tell Dad why . I never told him anything . It ’s always been a hard thing for me to tell things , Valancy — anything that went deep . And most things went deep with me . I was a sensitive child and I was even more sensitive as a boy . No one ever knew what I suffered . Dad never dreamed of it .
82116	82162	82164	82164	his	2097	“ When he sent me to a private school — I was only eleven — the boys ducked me in the swimming - tank until I stood on a table and read aloud all the advertisements of Father ’s patent abominations . I did it — then”—Barney
82165	82198	82199	82199	Barney	140	fists—“I was frightened and half drowned and all my world was against me . But when I went to college and the sophs tried the same stunt I did n’t do it . ”
82203	82471	82199	82199	Barney	140	“ They could n’t make me do it . But they could — and did — make my life miserable . I never heard the last of the Pills and the Bitters and the Hair Tonic . ‘ After using ’ was my nickname — you see I ’d always such a thick thatch . My four college years were a nightmare . You know — or you do n’t know — what merciless beasts boys can be when they get a victim like me . I had few friends — there was always some barrier between me and the kind of people I cared for . And the other kind — who would have been very willing to be intimate with rich old Doc . Redfern ’s son — I did n’t care for . But I had one friend — or thought I had . A clever , bookish chap — a bit of a writer . That was a bond between us — I had some secret aspirations along that line . He was older than I was — I looked up to him and worshipped him . For a year I was happier than I ’d ever been . Then — a burlesque sketch came out in the college magazine — a mordant thing , ridiculing Dad ’s remedies . The names were changed , of course , but everybody knew what and who was meant . Oh , it was clever — damnably so — and witty . McGill rocked with laughter over it . I found out he had written it . ”
82472	82479	82480	82480	Valancy	307	“ Oh , were you sure ? ”
82488	82618	82480	82480	Valancy	307	“ Yes . He admitted it when I asked him . Said a good idea was worth more to him than a friend , any time . And he added a gratuitous thrust . ‘ You know , Redfern , there are some things money wo n’t buy . For instance — it wo n’t buy you a grandfather . ’ Well , it was a nasty slam . I was young enough to feel cut up . And it destroyed a lot of my ideals and illusions , which was the worst thing about it . I was a young misanthrope after that . Did n’t want to be friends with any one . And then — the year after I left college — I met Ethel Traverse . ”
82642	82788	82480	82480	Valancy	307	“ Dad told you about her , I suppose . She was very beautiful . And I loved her . Oh , yes , I loved her . I wo n’t deny it or belittle it now . It was a lonely , romantic boy ’s first passionate love , and it was very real . And I thought she loved me . I was fool enough to think that . I was wildly happy when she promised to marry me . For a few months . Then — I found out she did n’t . I was an involuntary eavesdropper on a certain occasion for a moment . That moment was enough . The proverbial fate of the eavesdropper overtook me . A girl friend of hers was asking her how she could stomach Doc . Redfern ’s son and the patent - medicine background .
82789	82840	82877	82877	she	2100	“ ‘ His money will gild the Pills and sweeten the Bitters , ’ said Ethel , with a laugh . ‘ Mother told me to catch him if I could . We ’re on the rocks . But pah ! I smell turpentine whenever he comes near me . ’ ”
82841	82846	82848	82848	Valancy	307	“ Oh , Barney ! ”
82879	82880	82877	82877	she	2100	“ Well,”—Barney
82888	83137	82877	82877	she	2100	room—“that finished me . Completely . I left civilisation and those accursed dopes behind me and went to the Yukon . For five years I knocked about the world — in all sorts of outlandish places . I earned enough to live on — I would n’t touch a cent of Dad ’s money . Then one day I woke up to the fact that I no longer cared a hang about Ethel , one way or another . She was somebody I ’d known in another world — that was all . But I had no hankering to go back to the old life . None of that for me . I was free and I meant to keep so . I came to Mistawis — saw Tom MacMurray ’s island . My first book had been published the year before , and made a hit — I had a bit of money from my royalties . I bought my island . But I kept away from people . I had no faith in anybody . I did n’t believe there was such a thing as real friendship or true love in the world — not for me , anyhow — the son of Purple Pills . I used to revel in all the wild yarns they told of me . In fact , I ’m afraid I suggested a few of them myself . By mysterious remarks which people interpreted in the light of their own prepossessions .
83138	83340	83611	83611	she	2101	“ Then — you came . I had to believe you loved me — really loved me — not my father ’s millions . There was no other reason why you should want to marry a penniless devil with my supposed record . And I was sorry for you . Oh , yes , I do n’t deny I married you because I was sorry for you . And then — I found you the best and jolliest and dearest little pal and chum a fellow ever had . Witty — loyal — sweet . You made me believe again in the reality of friendship and love . The world seemed good again just because you were in it , honey . I ’d have been willing to go on forever just as we were . I knew that , the night I came home and saw my homelight shining out from the island for the first time . And knew you were there waiting for me . After being homeless all my life it was beautiful to have a home . To come home hungry at night and know there was a good supper and a cheery fire — and you .
83341	83609	82877	82877	she	2100	“ But I did n’t realise what you actually meant to me till that moment at the switch . Then it came like a lightning flash . I knew I could n’t live without you — that if I could n’t pull you loose in time I ’d have to die with you . I admit it bowled me over — knocked me silly . I could n’t get my bearings for a while . That ’s why I acted like a mule . But the thought that drove me to the tall timber was the awful one that you were going to die . I ’d always hated the thought of it — but I supposed there was n’t any chance for you , so I put it out of my mind . Now I had to face it — you were under sentence of death and I could n’t live without you . When I came home last night I had made up my mind that I ’d take you to all the specialists in the world — that something surely could be done for you . I felt sure you could n’t be as bad as Dr. Trent thought , when those moments on the track had n’t even hurt you . And I found your note — and went mad with happiness — and a little terror for fear you did n’t care much for me , after all , and had gone away to get rid of me . But now , it ’s all right , is n’t it , darling ? ”
83616	83618	83611	83611	she	2101	“ darling ”
83620	83630	83631	83631	she	2101	“ I ca n’t believe you care for me , ”
83635	83692	83693	83693	She	2101	“ I know you ca n’t . What ’s the use , Barney ? Of course , you ’re sorry for me — of course you want to do the best you can to straighten out the mess . But it ca n’t be straightened out that way . You could n’t love me — me . ”
83751	83835	83734	83734	He	2102	“ Love you ! Girl , you ’re in the very core of my heart . I hold you there like a jewel . Did n’t I promise you I ’d never tell you a lie ? Love you ! I love you with all there is of me to love . Heart , soul , brain . Every fibre of body and spirit thrilling to the sweetness of you . There ’s nobody in the world for me but you , Valancy . ”
83836	83845	83847	83847	Valancy	307	“ You’re — a good actor , Barney , ”
83860	83870	83855	83855	Barney	140	“ So you do n’t believe me — yet ? ”
83871	83876	83734	83734	He	2102	“ I — can t. ”
83877	83882	83884	83884	Barney	140	“ Oh — damn ! ”
83914	83923	83925	83925	Barney	140	“ You do n’t want to believe it , ”
83936	84039	83925	83925	Barney	140	“ You ’re tired of me . You want to get out of it — free from me . You ’re ashamed of the Pills and the Liniment , just as she was . Your Stirling pride ca n’t stomach them . It was all right as long as you thought you had n’t long to live . A good lark — you could put up with me . But a lifetime with old Doc Redfern ’s son is a different thing . Oh , I understand — perfectly . I ’ve been very dense — but I understand , at last . ”
84057	84061	84062	84062	she	2104	“ You darling ! ”
84065	84088	84053	84053	she	2104	“ You do mean it ! You do really love me ! You would n’t be so enraged if you did n’t . ”
84140	84146	84147	84147	he	2105	“ Everything is all right , ”
84208	84211	84185	84186	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ Marriages . ”
84214	84219	84221	84221	Valancy	307	“ But , Barney , ”
84227	84243	84221	84221	Valancy	307	“ your father — somehow — gave me to understand that you still loved her . ”
84244	84290	84185	84186	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ He would . Dad holds the championship for making blunders . If there ’s a thing that ’s better left unsaid you can trust him to say it . But he is n’t a bad old soul , Valancy . You ’ll like him . ”
84291	84297	84221	84221	Valancy	307	“ I do , now . ”
84298	84334	84185	84186	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ And his money is n’t tainted money . He made it honestly . His medicines are quite harmless . Even his Purple Pills do people whole heaps of good when they believe in them . ”
84335	84345	84347	84347	Valancy	307	“ But — I’m not fit for your life , ”
84349	84364	84347	84347	Valancy	307	“ I ’m not — clever — or well - educated — or — — ”
84365	84418	84185	84186	Mrs. Frederick	99	“ My life is in Mistawis — and all the wild places of the world . I ’m not going to ask you to live the life of a society woman . Of course , we must spend a bit of the time with Dad — he ’s lonely and old — — ”
84419	84429	84431	84431	Valancy	307	“ But not in that big house of his , ”
84433	84442	84431	84431	Valancy	307	“ I ca n’t live in a palace . ”
84443	84455	84457	84457	Barney	140	“ Ca n’t come down to that after your Blue Castle , ”
84459	84622	84457	84457	Barney	140	“ Do n’t worry , sweet . I could n’t live in that house myself . It has a white marble stairway with gilt bannisters and looks like a furniture shop with the labels off . Likewise it ’s the pride of Dad ’s heart . We ’ll get a little house somewhere outside of Montreal — in the real country — near enough to see Dad often . I think we ’ll build one for ourselves . A house you build for yourself is so much nicer than a hand - me - down . But we ’ll spend our summers in Mistawis . And our autumns travelling . I want you to see the Alhambra — it ’s the nearest thing to the Blue Castle of your dreams I can think of . And there ’s an old - world garden in Italy where I want to show you the moon rising over Rome through the dark cypress - trees . ”
84623	84636	84431	84431	Valancy	307	“ Will that be any lovelier than the moon rising over Mistawis ? ”
84637	84769	84457	84457	Barney	140	“ Not lovelier . But a different kind of loveliness . There are so many kinds of loveliness . Valancy , before this year you ’ve spent all your life in ugliness . You know nothing of the beauty of the world . We ’ll climb mountains — hunt for treasures in the bazaars of Samarcand — search out the magic of east and west — run hand in hand to the rim of the world . I want to show you it all — see it again through your eyes . Girl , there are a million things I want to show you — do with you — say to you . It will take a lifetime . And we must see about that picture by Tierney , after all . ”
84770	84778	84780	84780	Valancy	307	“ Will you promise me one thing ? ”
84783	84786	84788	84788	Barney	140	“ Anything , ”
84791	84822	84457	84457	Barney	140	“ Only one thing . You are never , under any circumstances or under any provocation , to cast it up to me that I asked you to marry me . ”
84838	84867	84457	84457	Barney	140	“ It ’s really disgusting that Doss ’ crazy adventures should have turned out like this . It makes one feel that there is no use in behaving properly .
84868	84949	84457	84457	Barney	140	“ I ’m sure her mind was unbalanced when she left home . What she said about a dust - pile showed that . Of course I do n’t think there was ever a thing the matter with her heart . Or perhaps Snaith or Redfern or whatever his name really is fed Purple Pills to her , back in that Mistawis hut and cured her . It would make quite a testimonial for the family ads , would n’t it ?
84950	84980	84457	84457	Barney	140	“ He ’s such an insignificent - looking creature . I mentioned this to Doss but all she said was , ‘ I do n’t like collar ad men . ’
84981	85036	84457	84457	Barney	140	“ Well , he ’s certainly no collar ad man . Though I must say there is something rather distinguished about him , now that he has cut his hair and put on decent clothes . I really think , Cecil , you should exercise more . It does n’t do to get too fleshy .
85037	85063	84457	84457	Barney	140	“ He also claims , I believe , to be John Foster . We can believe that or not , as we like , I suppose .
85064	85128	84457	84457	Barney	140	“ Old Doc Redfern has given them two millions for a wedding - present . Evidently the Purple Pills bring in the bacon . They ’re going to spend the fall in Italy and the winter in Egypt and motor through Normandy in apple - blossom time . Not in that dreadful old Lizzie , though . Redfern has got a wonderful new car .
85129	85149	84457	84457	Barney	140	“ Well , I think I ’ll run away , too , and disgrace myself . It seems to pay .
85150	85227	84457	84457	Barney	140	“ Uncle Ben is a scream . Likewise Uncle James . The fuss they all make over Doss now is absolutely sickening . To hear Aunt Amelia talking of ‘ my son - in - law , Bernard Redfern ’ and ‘ my daughter , Mrs. Bernard Redfern . ’ Mother and Father are as bad as the rest . And they ca n’t see that Valancy is just laughing at them all in her sleeve . ”
85353	85377	85348	85348	Valancy	315	“ Do n’t cry , Moonlight . We ’ll be back next summer . And now we ’re off for a real honeymoon . ”
