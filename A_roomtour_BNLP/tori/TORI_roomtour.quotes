33	43	45	46	Miss Bartlett	114	“ The Signora had no business to do it , ”
48	88	45	46	Miss Bartlett	114	“ no business at all . She promised us south rooms with a view close together , instead of which here are north rooms , looking into a courtyard , and a long way apart . Oh , Lucy ! ”
89	96	98	98	Lucy	115	“ And a Cockney , besides ! ”
112	118	119	119	She	115	“ It might be London . ”
205	246	341	341	she	115	“ Charlotte , do n’t you feel , too , that we might be in London ? I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside . I suppose it is one ’s being so tired . ”
247	257	259	260	Miss Bartlett	114	“ This meat has surely been used for soup , ”
267	310	259	260	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I want so to see the Arno . The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno . The Signora had no business to do it at all . Oh , it is a shame ! ”
311	318	319	320	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Any nook does for me , ”
323	337	319	320	Miss Bartlett	114	“ but it does seem hard that you should n’t have a view . ”
346	379	341	341	she	115	“ Charlotte , you must n’t spoil me : of course , you must look over the Arno , too . I meant that . The first vacant room in the front — ”
380	386	388	389	Miss Bartlett	114	“ You must have it , ”
416	426	409	409	she	114	“ No , no . You must have it . ”
427	442	388	389	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I insist on it . Your mother would never forgive me , Lucy . ”
443	449	450	451	The ladies	333	“ She would never forgiveme . ”
523	534	520	520	He	336	“ I have a view , I have a view . ”
565	567	576	577	the intruder	341	“ do ”
686	701	671	671	she	114	“ A view ? Oh , a view ! How delightful a view is ! ”
702	708	710	712	the old man	346	“ This is my son , ”
714	726	710	712	the old man	346	“ his name ’s George . He has a view too . ”
727	730	732	733	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Ah , ”
744	749	750	750	he	341	“ What I mean , ”
753	772	750	750	he	341	“ is that you can have our rooms , and we ’ll have yours . We ’ll change . ”
807	821	798	798	her	114	“ Thank you very much indeed ; that is out of the question . ”
822	825	827	829	the old man	346	“ Why ? ”
838	851	827	829	the old man	346	“ Because it is quite out of the question , thank you . ”
852	863	865	865	Lucy	115	“ You see , we do n’t like to take — ”
873	877	878	878	he	341	“ But why ? ”
881	893	878	878	he	341	“ Women like looking at a view ; men do n’t . ”
913	919	895	895	he	341	“ George , persuade them ! ”
920	931	933	934	the son	353	“ It ’s so obvious they should have the rooms , ”
936	944	945	945	He	341	“ There ’s nothing else to say . ”
983	988	975	975	they	333	“ quite a scene , ”
1111	1118	1102	1102	She	114	“ Are you all like this ? ”
1148	1157	1102	1102	She	114	“ We are not ; we are genteel . ”
1158	1165	1166	1166	she	114	“ Eat your dinner , dear , ”
1195	1217	1220	1220	she	114	“ Eat your dinner , dear . This pension is a failure . To - morrow we will make a change . ”
1284	1319	1279	1279	her	115	“ Oh , oh ! Why , it ’s Mr. Beebe ! Oh , how perfectly lovely ! Oh , Charlotte , we must stop now , however bad the rooms are . Oh ! ”
1328	1370	1320	1321	Miss Bartlett	114	“ How do you do , Mr. Beebe ? I expect that you have forgotten us : Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch , who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter ’s that very cold Easter . ”
1415	1422	1424	1434	the girl , who was in a state of spiritual starvation	365	“ Iamso glad to see you , ”
1452	1472	1424	1434	the girl , who was in a state of spiritual starvation	365	“ Just fancy how small the world is . Summer Street , too , makes it so specially funny . ”
1473	1484	1486	1487	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street , ”
1494	1514	1486	1487	Miss Bartlett	114	“ and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living — ”
1515	1555	1424	1434	the girl , who was in a state of spiritual starvation	365	“ Yes , I heard from mother so last week . She did n’t know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells ; but I wrote back at once , and I said : ‘ Mr. Beebe is — ’ ”
1556	1560	1562	1563	the clergyman	368	“ Quite right , ”
1565	1589	1562	1563	the clergyman	368	“ I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June . I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood . ”
1590	1607	1424	1434	the girl , who was in a state of spiritual starvation	365	“ Oh , how glad I am ! The name of our house is Windy Corner . ”
1612	1646	1608	1609	Mr. Beebe	120	“ There is mother and me generally , and my brother , though it ’s not often we get him to ch — — The church is rather far off , I mean . ”
1647	1659	1689	1690	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Lucy , dearest , let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner . ”
1660	1673	1674	1674	He	120	“ I am eating it , thank you , and enjoying it . ”
1738	1746	1747	1747	his	120	“ Do n’t neglect the country round , ”
1751	1772	1747	1747	his	120	“ The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole , and round by Settignano , or something of that sort . ”
1773	1776	1747	1747	his	120	“ No ! ”
1787	1806	1747	1747	his	120	“ Mr. Beebe , you are wrong . The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato . ”
1807	1814	1816	1817	Miss Bartlett	114	“ That lady looks so clever , ”
1822	1828	1816	1817	Miss Bartlett	114	“ We are in luck . ”
1927	1963	1921	1923	the clever lady	380	“ Prato ! They must go to Prato . That place is too sweetly squalid for words . I love it ; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability , as you know . ”
2247	2255	2256	2256	she	114	“ We are most grateful to you , ”
2260	2280	2256	2256	she	114	“ The first evening means so much . When you arrived we were in for a peculiarlymauvais quart d’heure . ”
2286	2308	2281	2281	He	120	“ Do you , by any chance , know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner ? ”
2309	2312	2256	2256	she	114	“ Emerson . ”
2313	2321	2256	2256	she	114	“ Is he a friend of yours ? ”
2322	2333	2281	2281	He	120	“ We are friendly — as one is in pensions . ”
2334	2342	2343	2343	He	120	“ Then I will say no more . ”
2354	2362	2363	2363	she	114	“ I am , as it were , ”
2366	2412	2363	2363	she	114	“ the chaperon of my young cousin , Lucy , and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing . His manner was somewhat unfortunate . I hope I acted for the best . ”
2413	2419	2421	2421	he	120	“ You acted very naturally , ”
2434	2451	2423	2423	He	120	“ All the same , I do n’t think much harm would have come of accepting . ”
2452	2467	2363	2363	she	114	“ Noharm , of course . But we could not be under an obligation . ”
2468	2476	2423	2423	He	120	“ He is rather a peculiar man . ”
2486	2576	2478	2478	he	120	“ I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance , nor expect you to show gratitude . He has the merit — if it is one — of saying exactly what he means . He has rooms he does not value , and he thinks you would value them . He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite . It is so difficult — at least , I find it difficult — to understand people who speak the truth . ”
2584	2604	2577	2577	Lucy	115	“ I was hoping that he was nice ; I do so always hope that people will be nice . ”
2605	2721	2363	2363	she	114	“ I think he is ; nice and tiresome . I differ from him on almost every point of any importance , and so , I expect — I may say I hope — you will differ . But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores . When he first came here he not unnaturally put people ’s backs up . He has no tact and no manners — I do n’t mean by that that he has bad manners — and he will not keep his opinions to himself . We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora , but I am glad to say we thought better of it . ”
2722	2728	2730	2731	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Am I to conclude , ”
2733	2740	2730	2731	Miss Bartlett	114	“ that he is a Socialist ? ”
2757	2773	2741	2742	Mr. Beebe	120	“ And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist , too ? ”
2774	2828	2363	2363	she	114	“ I hardly know George , for he has n’t learnt to talk yet . He seems a nice creature , and I think he has brains . Of course , he has all his father ’s mannerisms , and it is quite possible that he , too , may be a Socialist . ”
2829	2836	2838	2839	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Oh , you relieve me , ”
2841	2864	2838	2839	Miss Bartlett	114	“ So you think I ought to have accepted their offer ? You feel I have been narrow - minded and suspicious ? ”
2865	2870	2871	2871	he	398	“ Not at all , ”
2874	2880	2871	2871	he	398	“ I never suggested that . ”
2881	2898	2899	2899	He	398	“ But ought I not to apologize , at all events , for my apparent rudeness ? ”
2927	2933	2935	2936	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Was I a bore ? ”
2945	2990	2935	2936	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Why did n’t you talk , Lucy ? He prefers young people , I ’m sure . I do hope I have n’t monopolized him . I hoped you would have him all the evening , as well as all dinner - time . ”
2991	2996	2998	2998	Lucy	115	“ He is nice , ”
3000	3023	2998	2998	Lucy	115	“ Just what I remember . He seems to see good in everyone . No one would take him for a clergyman . ”
3024	3029	2935	2936	Miss Bartlett	114	“ My dear Lucia — ”
3030	3056	2935	2936	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Well , you know what I mean . And you know how clergymen generally laugh ; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man . ”
3057	3080	2998	2998	Lucy	115	“ Funny girl ! How you do remind me of your mother . I wonder if she will approve of Mr. Beebe . ”
3081	3093	2935	2936	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I ’m sure she will ; and so will Freddy . ”
3094	3126	2935	2936	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve ; it is the fashionable world . I am used to Tunbridge Wells , where we are all hopelessly behind the times . ”
3127	3130	3132	3132	Lucy	115	“ Yes , ”
3204	3217	3193	3194	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion . ”
3224	3249	3219	3220	the girl	369	“ I must have been selfish or unkind ; I must be more careful . It is so dreadful for Charlotte , being poor . ”
3421	3438	3554	3554	one	2114	“ But here you are as safe as in England . Signora Bertolini is so English . ”
3439	3445	3448	3448	Lucy	115	“ Yet our rooms smell , ”
3450	3457	3448	3448	Lucy	115	“ We dread going to bed . ”
3458	3468	3469	3469	She	369	“ Ah , then you look into the court . ”
3472	3490	3469	3469	She	369	“ If only Mr. Emerson was more tactful ! We were so sorry for you at dinner . ”
3491	3501	3448	3448	Lucy	115	“ I think he was meaning to be kind . ”
3502	3507	3509	3510	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Undoubtedly he was , ”
3512	3538	3509	3510	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature . Of course , I was holding back on my cousin ’s account . ”
3539	3543	3545	3548	the little old lady	410	“ Of course , ”
3601	3645	3554	3554	one	2114	“ About old Mr. Emerson — I hardly know . No , he is not tactful ; yet , have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate , and yet at the same time — beautiful ? ”
3646	3649	3651	3652	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Beautiful ? ”
3659	3668	3651	3652	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Are not beauty and delicacy the same ? ”
3669	3676	3678	3680	the other helplessly	417	“ So one would have thought , ”
3682	3693	3694	3694	She	114	“ But things are so difficult , I sometimes think . ”
3710	3714	3715	3715	he	120	“ Miss Bartlett , ”
3718	3774	3715	3715	he	120	“ it ’s all right about the rooms . I ’m so glad . Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking - room , and knowing what I did , I encouraged him to make the offer again . He has let me come and ask you . He would be so pleased . ”
3775	3780	3782	3782	Lucy	115	“ Oh , Charlotte , ”
3787	3809	3782	3782	Lucy	115	“ we must have the rooms now . The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be . ”
3815	3819	3821	3822	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I fear , ”
3828	3842	3846	3846	he	120	“ that I have been officious . I must apologize for my interference . ”
3859	3951	3952	3952	She	419	“ My own wishes , dearest Lucy , are unimportant in comparison with yours . It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence , when I am only here through your kindness . If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms , I will do it . Would you then , Mr. Beebe , kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer , and then conduct him to me , in order that I may thank him personally ? ”
3995	4026	3978	3979	The clergyman	368	“ Remember , Lucy , I alone am implicated in this . I do not wish the acceptance to come from you . Grant me that , at all events . ”
4036	4049	4027	4028	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Mr. Emerson is engaged , but here is his son instead . ”
4073	4077	4078	4078	he	381	“ My father , ”
4081	4117	4078	4078	he	381	“ is in his bath , so you can not thank him personally . But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out . ”
4157	4162	4164	4165	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Poor young man ! ”
4174	4196	4164	4165	Miss Bartlett	114	“ How angry he is with his father about the rooms ! It is all he can do to keep polite . ”
4197	4210	4212	4213	Mr. Beebe	120	“ In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready , ”
4238	4243	4245	4248	the little old lady	410	“ Oh , dear ! ”
4264	4271	4272	4272	Her	410	“ Gentlemen sometimes do not realize — ”
4366	4388	4356	4357	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I think one might venture now . No , Lucy , do not stir . I will superintend the move . ”
4389	4396	4398	4398	Lucy	115	“ How you do do everything , ”
4400	4410	4356	4357	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Naturally , dear . It is my affair . ”
4411	4420	4356	4357	Miss Bartlett	114	“ But I would like to help you . ”
4421	4426	4356	4357	Miss Bartlett	114	“ No , dear . ”
4505	4511	4513	4514	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I want to explain , ”
4516	4565	4566	4566	Lucy	115	“ why it is that I have taken the largest room . Naturally , of course , I should have given it to you ; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man , and I was sure your mother would not like it . ”
4570	4634	4672	4672	she	114	“ If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him . I am a woman of the world , in my small way , and I know where things lead to . However , Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this . ”
4635	4644	4646	4646	Lucy	115	“ Mother would n’t mind I ’m sure , ”
4818	4824	4825	4825	she	114	“ What does it mean ? ”
5505	5596	5499	5501	the clever lady	380	“ If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you , I do assure you that you can neglect the good person . Being English , Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe . Italians understand . A dear friend of mine , Contessa Baroncelli , has two daughters , and when she can not send a maid to school with them , she lets them go in sailor - hats instead . Every one takes them for English , you see , especially if their hair is strained tightly behind . ”
5656	5684	5685	5685	Lucy	115	“ I will take you by a dear dirty back way , Miss Honeychurch , and if you bring me luck , we shall have an adventure . ”
5707	5760	5651	5651	she	380	“ Tut , tut ! Miss Lucy ! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker . He does but touch the surface of things . As to the true Italy — he does not even dream of it . The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation . ”
5919	5941	5916	5916	she	140	“ A smell ! a true Florentine smell ! Every city , let me teach you , has its own smell . ”
5942	5950	5952	5952	Lucy	115	“ Is it a very nice smell ? ”
5965	5975	5916	5916	she	140	“ One does n’t come to Italy for niceness , ”
5980	5992	5916	5916	she	140	“ one comes for life . Buon giorno ! Buon giorno ! ”
5998	6019	5916	5916	she	140	“ Look at that adorable wine - cart ! How the driver stares at us , dear , simple soul ! ”
6088	6136	6416	6417	Miss Lavish	140	“ Buon giorno ! Take the word of an old woman , Miss Lucy : you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors . Thatis the true democracy . Though I am a real Radical as well . There , now you ’re shocked . ”
6137	6144	6146	6146	Lucy	115	“ Indeed , I ’m not ! ”
6148	6175	6416	6417	Miss Lavish	140	“ We are Radicals , too , out and out . My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone , until he was so dreadful about Ireland . ”
6176	6193	6416	6417	Miss Lavish	140	“ I see , I see . And now you have gone over to the enemy . ”
6194	6254	6416	6417	Miss Lavish	140	“ Oh , please — ! If my father was alive , I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right . And as it is , the glass over our front door was broken last election , and Freddy is sure it was the Tories ; but mother says nonsense , a tramp . ”
6255	6265	6416	6417	Miss Lavish	140	“ Shameful ! A manufacturing district , I suppose ? ”
6266	6285	6416	6417	Miss Lavish	140	“ No — in the Surrey hills . About five miles from Dorking , looking over the Weald . ”
6296	6331	6286	6287	Miss Lavish	140	“ What a delightful part ; I know it so well . It is full of the very nicest people . Do you know Sir Harry Otway — a Radical if ever there was ? ”
6332	6337	6416	6417	Miss Lavish	140	“ Very well indeed . ”
6338	6346	6416	6417	Miss Lavish	140	“ And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist ? ”
6347	6360	6286	6287	Miss Lavish	140	“ Why , she rents a field of us ! How funny ! ”
6374	6383	6361	6362	Miss Lavish	140	“ Oh , you have property in Surrey ? ”
6384	6388	6390	6390	Lucy	115	“ Hardly any , ”
6399	6415	6390	6390	Lucy	115	“ Only thirty acres — just the garden , all downhill , and some fields . ”
6492	6508	6486	6486	she	140	“ Bless us ! Bless us and save us ! We ’ve lost the way . ”
6557	6609	6610	6610	Lucy	115	“ Lost ! lost ! My dear Miss Lucy , during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning . How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us ! What are we to do ? Two lone females in an unknown town . Now , this is whatIcall an adventure . ”
6634	6679	6610	6610	Lucy	115	“ Oh , but that is the word of a craven ! And no , you are not , not , notto look at your Baedeker . Give it to me ; I sha n’t let you carry it . We will simply drift . ”
6934	6978	6917	6918	Miss Lavish	140	“ Stop a minute ; let those two people go on , or I shall have to speak to them . I do detest conventional intercourse . Nasty ! they are going into the church , too . Oh , the Britisher abroad ! ”
6979	7002	7065	7066	Miss Lavish	140	“ We sat opposite them at dinner last night . They have given us their rooms . They were so very kind . ”
7003	7009	7011	7012	Miss Lavish	140	“ Look at their figures ! ”
7014	7056	7011	7012	Miss Lavish	140	“ They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows . It ’s very naughty of me , but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover , and turn back every tourist who could n’t pass it . ”
7057	7064	7065	7066	Miss Lavish	140	“ What would you ask us ? ”
7126	7143	7120	7120	her	140	“ There goes my local - colour box ! I must have a word with him ! ”
7755	7759	7764	7766	old Mr. Emerson	119	“ Hateful bishop ! ”
7774	7812	7764	7766	old Mr. Emerson	119	“ Hard in life , hard in death . Go out into the sunshine , little boy , and kiss your hand to the sun , for that is where you ought to be . Intolerable bishop ! ”
7846	7851	7853	7854	Mr. Emerson	119	“ Look at him ! ”
7858	7883	7853	7854	Mr. Emerson	119	“ Here ’s a mess : a baby hurt , cold , and frightened ! But what else can you expect from a church ? ”
7968	7975	7977	7978	Mr. Emerson	119	“ You are a clever woman , ”
7980	8022	8023	8023	He	119	“ You have done more than all the relics in the world . I am not of your creed , but I do believe in those who make their fellow - creatures happy . There is no scheme of the universe — ”
8029	8032	8034	8036	the Italian lady	543	“ Niente , ”
8044	8053	8055	8055	Lucy	115	“ I ’m not sure she understands English , ”
8102	8108	8110	8111	Mr. Emerson	119	“ That woman understands everything , ”
8115	8136	8110	8111	Mr. Emerson	119	“ But what are you doing here ? Are you doing the church ? Are you through with the church ? ”
8137	8140	8142	8142	Lucy	115	“ No , ”
8148	8191	8142	8142	Lucy	115	“ I came here with Miss Lavish , who was to explain everything ; and just by the door — it is too bad!—she simply ran away , and after waiting quite a time , I had to come in by myself . ”
8192	8198	8200	8201	Mr. Emerson	119	“ Why should n’t you ? ”
8203	8214	8216	8217	the son	353	“ Yes , why should n’t you come by yourself ? ”
8228	8238	8216	8217	the son	353	“ But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker . ”
8239	8242	8244	8245	Mr. Emerson	119	“ Baedeker ? ”
8247	8268	8244	8245	Mr. Emerson	119	“ I ’m glad it’sthatyou minded . It ’s worth minding , the loss of a Baedeker . That’sworth minding . ”
8292	8299	8301	8302	the son	353	“ If you ’ve no Baedeker , ”
8304	8311	8301	8302	the son	353	“ you ’d better join us . ”
8327	8392	8320	8320	She	115	“ Thank you very much , but I could not think of that . I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you . I really came to help with the child , and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night . I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience . ”
8393	8397	8399	8401	the old man	346	“ My dear , ”
8404	8462	8399	8401	the old man	346	“ I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say . You are pretending to be touchy ; but you are not really . Stop being so tiresome , and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see . To take you to it will be a real pleasure . ”
8565	8594	8595	8596	The son	353	“ I am not touchy , I hope . It is the Giottos that I want to see , if you will kindly tell me which they are . ”
8680	8683	8684	8684	he	562	“ Remember , ”
8688	8776	8684	8684	he	562	“ the facts about this church of Santa Croce ; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism , before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared . Observe how Giotto in these frescoes — now , unhappily , ruined by restoration — is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective . Could anything be more majestic , more pathetic , beautiful , true ? How little , we feel , avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels ! ”
8777	8780	8782	8783	Mr. Emerson	119	“ No ! ”
8794	8858	8859	8859	He	562	“ Remember nothing of the sort ! Built by faith indeed ! That simply means the workmen were n’t paid properly . And as for the frescoes , I see no truth in them . Look at that fat man in blue ! He must weigh as much as I do , and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon . ”
8867	8873	8859	8859	He	562	“ Ascension of St. John . ”
8935	8951	8952	8952	George	119	“ Now , did this happen , or did n’t it ? Yes or no ? ”
8955	9004	8952	8952	George	119	“ It happened like this , if it happened at all . I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs ; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it , just as they do here . ”
9005	9012	9014	9015	his father	383	“ You will never go up , ”
9017	9048	9014	9015	his father	383	“ You and I , dear boy , will lie at peace in the earth that bore us , and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives . ”
9049	9084	9014	9015	his father	383	“ Some of the people can only see the empty grave , not the saint , whoever he is , going up . It did happen like that , if it happened at all . ”
9085	9089	9014	9015	his father	383	“ Pardon me , ”
9095	9112	9014	9015	his father	383	“ The chapel is somewhat small for two parties . We will incommode you no longer . ”
9173	9176	9178	9179	Mr. Emerson	119	“ Stop ! ”
9181	9193	9178	9179	Mr. Emerson	119	“ There ’s plenty of room for us all . Stop ! ”
9219	9232	9202	9203	the lecturer	564	“ George , I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate . ”
9243	9253	9233	9233	George	119	“ Perhaps he is . I do n’t remember . ”
9254	9310	9202	9203	the lecturer	564	“ Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am . It ’s that Mr. Eager . Why did he go ? Did we talk too loud ? How vexatious . I shall go and say we are sorry . Had n’t I better ? Then perhaps he will come back . ”
9311	9318	9320	9320	George	119	“ He will not come back , ”
9393	9403	9404	9404	he	580	“ My father has that effect on nearly everyone , ”
9408	9416	9404	9404	he	580	“ He will try to be kind . ”
9417	9424	9426	9426	she	115	“ I hope we all try , ”
9431	9464	9426	9426	she	115	“ Because we think it improves our characters . But he is kind to people because he loves them ; and they find him out , and are offended , or frightened . ”
9465	9471	9473	9473	Lucy	115	“ How silly of them ! ”
9482	9492	9473	9473	Lucy	115	“ I think that a kind action done tactfully — ”
9493	9496	9497	9497	He	580	“ Tact ! ”
9648	9653	9655	9656	his son	352	“ Were you snubbed ? ”
9659	9681	9655	9656	his son	352	“ But we have spoilt the pleasure of I do n’t know how many people . They wo n’t come back . ”
9682	9703	9730	9730	Lucy	115	“ ... full of innate sympathy ... quickness to perceive good in others ... vision of the brotherhood of man ... ”
9718	9726	9727	9727	he	119	“ Do n’t let us spoil yours , ”
9732	9740	9727	9727	he	119	“ Have you looked at those saints ? ”
9741	9744	9746	9746	Lucy	115	“ Yes , ”
9748	9766	9746	9746	Lucy	115	“ They are lovely . Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin ? ”
9892	9901	9902	9902	he	119	“ Why will he look at that fresco ? ”
9906	9913	9902	9902	he	119	“ I saw nothing in it . ”
9914	9919	9920	9920	she	597	“ I like Giotto , ”
9923	9947	9920	9920	she	597	“ It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values . Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better . ”
9948	9983	9984	9984	Lucy	115	“ So you ought . A baby is worth a dozen saints . And my baby ’s worth the whole of Paradise , and as far as I can see he lives in Hell . ”
9993	9997	9998	9998	he	597	“ In Hell , ”
10001	10006	9998	9998	he	597	“ He ’s unhappy . ”
10007	10012	10014	10014	Lucy	115	“ Oh , dear ! ”
10016	10083	10014	10014	Lucy	115	“ How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive ? What more is one to give him ? And think how he has been brought up — free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God . With such an education as that , I thought he was bound to grow up happy . ”
10134	10143	10144	10144	he	598	“ What are we to do with him ? ”
10147	10189	10144	10144	he	598	“ He comes out for his holiday to Italy , and behaves — like that ; like the little child who ought to have been playing , and who hurt himself upon the tombstone . Eh ? What did you say ? ”
10200	10349	10197	10197	he	598	“ Now do n’t be stupid over this . I do n’t require you to fall in love with my boy , but I do think you might try and understand him . You are nearer his age , and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible . You might help me . He has known so few women , and you have the time . You stop here several weeks , I suppose ? But let yourself go . You are inclined to get muddled , if I may judge from last night . Let yourself go . Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand , and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them . By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself . It will be good for both of you . ”
10359	10377	10197	10197	he	598	“ I only know what it is that ’s wrong with him ; not why it is . ”
10378	10384	10386	10386	Lucy	115	“ And what is it ? ”
10394	10404	10386	10386	Lucy	115	“ The old trouble ; things wo n’t fit . ”
10405	10409	10197	10197	he	598	“ What things ? ”
10410	10426	10197	10197	he	598	“ The things of the universe . It is quite true . They do n’t . ”
10427	10438	10440	10440	his	602	“ Oh , Mr. Emerson , whatever do you mean ? ”
10457	10565	10454	10454	he	602	“ ‘ From far , from eve and morning , And yon twelve - winded sky , The stuff of life to knit meBlew hither : here am I ’ George and I both know this , but why does it distress him ? We know that we come from the winds , and that we shall return to them ; that all life is perhaps a knot , a tangle , a blemish in the eternal smoothness . But why should this make us unhappy ? Let us rather love one another , and work and rejoice . I do n’t believe in this world sorrow . ”
10570	10606	10566	10567	Miss Honeychurch	121	“ Then make my boy think like us . Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes — a transitory Yes if you like , but a Yes . ”
10644	10650	10651	10651	she	121	“ I ’m very sorry , ”
10654	10665	10651	10651	she	121	“ You ’ll think me unfeeling , but — but — ”
10671	10730	10667	10667	she	121	“ Oh , but your son wants employment . Has he no particular hobby ? Why , I myself have worries , but I can generally forget them at the piano ; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother . Perhaps Italy bores him ; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes . ”
10842	10846	10839	10839	He	346	“ Miss Bartlett . ”
10847	10854	10856	10856	Lucy	115	“ Oh , good gracious me ! ”
10872	10877	10856	10856	Lucy	115	“ Where ? Where ? ”
10878	10883	10839	10839	He	346	“ In the nave . ”
10884	10896	10897	10897	She	115	“ I see . Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have — ”
10901	10905	10899	10899	herself	115	“ Poor girl ! ”
10910	10914	10907	10908	Mr. Emerson	119	“ Poor girl ! ”
10932	11030	11031	11031	She	115	“ Poor girl ? I fail to understand the point of that remark . I think myself a very fortunate girl , I assure you . I ’m thoroughly happy , and having a splendid time . Pray do n’t waste time mourning overme . There ’s enough sorrow in the world , is n’t there , without trying to invent it . Good - bye . Thank you both so much for all your kindness . Ah , yes ! there does come my cousin . A delightful morning ! Santa Croce is a wonderful church . ”
11562	11570	11572	11573	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Miss Honeychurch . Piano . Beethoven , ”
11712	11717	11718	11718	he	120	“ Who is she ? ”
11724	11772	11718	11718	he	120	“ Cousin of one of my parishioners . I do not consider her choice of a piece happy . Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that , which , if anything , disturbs . ”
11773	11777	11718	11718	he	120	“ Introduce me . ”
11778	11797	11718	11718	he	120	“ She will be delighted . She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon . ”
11798	11802	11804	11805	Mr. Beebe	120	“ My sermon ? ”
11807	11816	11804	11805	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Why ever did she listen to it ? ”
11920	11944	11902	11902	he	120	“ If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays , it will be very exciting both for us and for her . ”
11954	11983	11902	11902	he	120	“ Oh , what a funny thing ! Some one said just the same to mother , and she said she trusted I should never live a duet . ”
11984	11992	11902	11902	he	120	“ Does n’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music ? ”
11993	12071	11902	11902	he	120	“ She does n’t mind it . But she does n’t like one to get excited over anything ; she thinks I am silly about it . She thinks — I ca n’t make out . Once , you know , I said that I liked my own playing better than any one ’s . She has never got over it . Of course , I did n’t mean that I played well ; I only meant — ”
12072	12076	12078	12078	he	639	“ Of course , ”
12087	12090	12092	12092	Lucy	115	“ Music — ”
12186	12191	12193	12194	Mr. Beebe	120	“ What about music ? ”
12196	12203	12205	12205	Lucy	115	“ Poor Charlotte will be sopped , ”
12295	12317	12267	12267	she	114	“ Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray . She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe . ”
12318	12325	12327	12327	Lucy	115	“ Miss Lavish is so original , ”
12384	12389	12391	12391	Lucy	115	“ Is it true , ”
12398	12407	12391	12391	Lucy	115	“ that Miss Lavish is writing a book ? ”
12408	12414	12391	12391	Lucy	115	“ They do say so . ”
12415	12421	12391	12391	Lucy	115	“ What is it about ? ”
12422	12429	12431	12432	Mr. Beebe	120	“ It will be a novel , ”
12434	12464	12431	12432	Mr. Beebe	120	“ dealing with modern Italy . Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan , who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know . ”
12465	12523	12391	12391	Lucy	115	“ I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself . We started such friends . But I do n’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce . Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone , and so I could n’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish . ”
12524	12538	12539	12539	He	652	“ The two ladies , at all events , have made it up . ”
12780	12824	12825	12825	She	115	“ Oh , dear Miss Honeychurch , you will catch a chill ! And Mr. Beebe here besides . Who would suppose this is Italy ? There is my sister actually nursing the hot - water can ; no comforts or proper provisions . ”
12856	12906	12907	12907	Lucy	115	“ I could hear your beautiful playing , Miss Honeychurch , though I was in my room with the door shut . Doors shut ; indeed , most necessary . No one has the least idea of privacy in this country . And one person catches it from another . ”
12940	12947	12948	12948	He	120	“ Fa niente , sono vecchia . ”
12954	13101	12948	12948	He	120	“ I quite agree with you , Miss Alan . The Italians are a most unpleasant people . They pry everywhere , they see everything , and they know what we want before we know it ourselves . We are at their mercy . They read our thoughts , they foretell our desires . From the cab - driver down to — to Giotto , they turn us inside out , and I resent it . Yet in their heart of hearts they are — how superficial ! They have no conception of the intellectual life . How right is Signora Bertolini , who exclaimed to me the other day : ‘ Ho , Mr. Beebe , if you knew what I suffer over the children ’s edjucaishion . Hiwon’t ’ ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what ca n’t explain nothink ! ’ ”
13214	13217	13196	13196	she	156	“ E. L. ”
13218	13224	13226	13227	the clergyman	368	“ That belongs to Lavish . ”
13229	13245	13226	13227	the clergyman	368	“ A good fellow , Lavish , but I wish she ’d start a pipe . ”
13246	13252	13254	13255	Miss Alan	156	“ Oh , Mr. Beebe , ”
13263	13313	13254	13255	Miss Alan	156	“ Indeed , though it is dreadful for her to smoke , it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose . She took to it , practically in despair , after her life ’s work was carried away in a landslip . Surely that makes it more excusable . ”
13314	13319	13321	13321	Lucy	115	“ What was that ? ”
13336	13587	13330	13331	Miss Alan	156	“ It was a novel — and I am afraid , from what I can gather , not a very nice novel . It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them , and I must say they nearly always do . Anyhow , she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink . She said : ‘ Can I have a little ink , please ? ’ But you know what Italians are , and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach , and the saddest thing of all is that she can not remember what she has written . The poor thing was very ill after it , and so got tempted into cigarettes . It is a great secret , but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel . She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour — this novel is to be about modern Italy ; the other was historical — but that she could not start till she had an idea . First she tried Perugia for an inspiration , then she came here — this must on no account get round . And so cheerful through it all ! I can not help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone , even if you do not approve of them . ”
13645	13673	13628	13628	She	156	“ All the same , she is a little too — I hardly like to say unwomanly , but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived . ”
13700	13740	13685	13685	he	120	“ I do n’t know , Miss Honeychurch , if you have noticed that Miss Pole , the lady who has so much yellow hair , takes lemonade . That old Mr. Emerson , who puts things very strangely — ”
13775	14208	13766	13766	she	156	“ Stomach . He warned Miss Pole of her stomach - acidity , he called it — and he may have meant to be kind . I must say I forgot myself and laughed ; it was so sudden . As Teresa truly said , it was no laughing matter . But the point is that Miss Lavish was positivelyattractedby his mentioning S. , and said she liked plain speaking , and meeting different grades of thought . She thought they were commercial travellers—‘drummers ’ was the word she used — and all through dinner she tried to prove that England , our great and beloved country , rests on nothing but commerce . Teresa was very much annoyed , and left the table before the cheese , saying as she did so : ‘ There , Miss Lavish , is one who can confute you better than I , ’ and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson . Then Miss Lavish said : ‘ Tut ! The early Victorians . ’ Just imagine ! ‘ Tut ! The early Victorians . ’ My sister had gone , and I felt bound to speak . I said : ‘ Miss Lavish , Iam an early Victorian ; at least , that is to say , I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen . ’ It was horrible speaking . I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go , and I must say she was dumbfounded , and made no reply . But , unluckily , Mr. Emerson overheard this part , and called in his deep voice : ‘ Quite so , quite so ! I honour the woman for her Irish visit . ’ The woman ! I tell things so badly ; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time , all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place . But that was not all . After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said : ‘ Miss Alan , I am going into the smoking - room to talk to those two nice men . Come , too . ’ Needless to say , I refused such an unsuitable invitation , and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas , and said that she had four brothers , all University men , except one who was in the army , who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers . ”
14209	14216	14218	14219	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Let me finish the story , ”
14225	14270	14218	14219	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole , myself , everyone , and finally said : ‘ I shall go alone . ’ She went . At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board , and began playing patience . ”
14271	14275	14277	14277	Lucy	115	“ Whatever happened ? ”
14279	14308	14277	14277	Lucy	115	“ No one knows . No one will ever know . Miss Lavish will never dare to tell , and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling . ”
14309	14331	14218	14219	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Mr. Beebe — old Mr. Emerson , is he nice or not nice ? I do so want to know . ”
14346	14381	14332	14333	Mr. Beebe	120	“ No ; but it is so difficult . Sometimes he is so silly , and then I do not mind him . Miss Alan , what do you think ? Is he nice ? ”
14408	14431	14394	14395	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I consider that you are bound to class him as nice , Miss Alan , after that business of the violets . ”
14432	14506	14507	14508	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Violets ? Oh , dear ! Who told you about the violets ? How do things get round ? A pension is a bad place for gossips . No , I can not forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager ’s lecture at Santa Croce . Oh , poor Miss Honeychurch ! It really was too bad . No , I have quite changed . I donotlike the Emersons . They arenotnice . ”
14734	14750	14752	14754	the little lady	682	“ But are n’t they always waylaying you to go out with them , dear ? ”
14757	14777	14752	14754	the little lady	682	“ Only once . Charlotte did n’t like it , and said something — quite politely , of course . ”
14778	14797	14752	14754	the little lady	682	“ Most right of her . They do n’t understand our ways . They must find their level . ”
14955	14962	14964	14965	Miss Alan	156	“ Too late to go out , ”
14972	14979	14964	14965	Miss Alan	156	“ All the galleries are shut . ”
14980	14988	14990	14990	Lucy	115	“ I think I shall go out , ”
14992	15012	14990	14990	Lucy	115	“ I want to go round the town in the circular tram — on the platform by the driver . ”
15038	15067	15019	15020	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I wish we could . Unluckily I have letters . If you do want to go out alone , wo n’t you be better on your feet ? ”
15068	15076	15078	15079	Miss Alan	156	“ Italians , dear , you know , ”
15081	15094	15078	15079	Miss Alan	156	“ Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through ! ”
15131	15141	15143	15144	Mr. Beebe	120	“ She ought n’t really to go at all , ”
15154	15169	15143	15144	Mr. Beebe	120	“ and she knows it . I put it down to too much Beethoven . ”
15660	15665	15666	15666	Venus	174	“ Birth of Venus . ”
15705	15708	15681	15682	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Tempesta , ”

16297	16305	16306	16306	she	115	“ Oh , what have I done ? ”
16381	16389	16378	16378	She	115	“ Oh , what have I done ? ”
16390	16394	16378	16378	She	115	“ You fainted . ”
16395	16403	16368	16368	she	115	“ I — I am very sorry . ”
16404	16410	16378	16378	She	115	“ How are you now ? ”
16411	16418	16378	16378	She	115	“ Perfectly well — absolutely well . ”
16427	16442	16420	16420	she	115	“ Then let us come home . There ’s no point in our stopping . ”
16486	16515	16516	16516	His	725	“ How very kind you have been ! I might have hurt myself falling . But now I am well . I can go alone , thank you . ”
16522	16528	16529	16529	she	115	“ Oh , my photographs ! ”
16533	16537	16529	16529	she	115	“ What photographs ? ”
16538	16558	16559	16559	She	115	“ I bought some photographs at Alinari ’s . I must have dropped them out there in the square . ”
16565	16576	16577	16577	He	725	“ Would you add to your kindness by fetching them ? ”
16609	16613	16614	16614	She	115	“ Miss Honeychurch ! ”
16623	16637	16614	16614	She	115	“ You sit still ; you are n’t fit to go home alone . ”
16638	16650	16598	16599	a maniac	743	“ Yes , I am , thank you so very much . ”
16651	16666	16614	16614	She	115	“ No , you are n’t . You ’d go openly if you were . ”
16667	16673	16614	16614	She	115	“ But I had rather — ”
16674	16683	16598	16599	a maniac	743	“ Then I do n’t fetch your photographs . ”
16684	16691	16692	16692	He	745	“ I had rather be alone . ”
16696	16715	16692	16692	He	745	“ The man is dead — the man is probably dead ; sit down till you are rested . ”
16724	16734	16722	16722	him	745	“ And do n’t move till I come back . ”
16791	16797	16789	16789	her	115	“ Oh , what have I done?”—the
16903	16959	16960	16960	He	751	“ And the murderer tried to kiss him , you say — how very odd Italians are!—and gave himself up to the police ! Mr. Beebe was saying that Italians know everything , but I think they are rather childish . When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday — What was that ? ”
16968	16975	16960	16960	He	751	“ What did you throw in ? ”
16976	16983	16984	16984	he	751	“ Things I did n’t want , ”
16988	16992	16984	16984	he	751	“ Mr. Emerson ! ”
16993	16996	16960	16960	He	751	“ Well ? ”
16997	17003	17004	17004	He	751	“ Where are the photographs ? ”
17008	17020	17004	17004	He	751	“ I believe it was my photographs that you threw away . ”
17021	17032	17033	17033	he	751	“ I did n’t know what to do with them , ”
17056	17090	17091	17091	He	751	“ They were covered with blood . There ! I ’m glad I ’ve told you ; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them . ”
17097	17102	17091	17091	He	751	“ They ’ve gone . ”
17110	17149	17091	17091	He	751	“ I did mind them so , and one is so foolish , it seemed better that they should go out to the sea — I do n’t know ; I may just mean that they frightened me . ”
17158	17183	17155	17156	a man	665	“ For something tremendous has happened ; I must face it without getting muddled . It is n’t exactly that a man has died . ”
17193	17198	17199	17199	he	751	“ It has happened , ”
17202	17213	17199	17199	he	751	“ and I mean to find out what it is . ”
17214	17218	17219	17219	He	751	“ Mr. Emerson — ”
17236	17248	17227	17227	she	115	“ I want to ask you something before we go in . ”
17305	17311	17298	17298	She	115	“ I have behaved ridiculously . ”
17319	17341	17312	17312	He	751	“ I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life ; I can not think what came over me . ”
17342	17348	17349	17349	he	751	“ I nearly fainted myself , ”
17361	17371	17353	17353	she	115	“ Well , I owe you a thousand apologies . ”
17372	17378	17312	17312	He	751	“ Oh , all right . ”
17379	17409	17312	17312	He	751	“ And — this is the real point — you know how silly people are gossiping — ladies especially , I am afraid — you understand what I mean ? ”
17410	17418	17353	17353	she	115	“ I ’m afraid I do n’t . ”
17419	17436	17312	17312	He	751	“ I mean , would you not mention it to any one , my foolish behaviour ? ”
17437	17451	17312	17312	He	751	“ Your behaviour ? Oh , yes , all right — all right . ”
17452	17462	17463	17463	She	115	“ Thank you so much . And would you — ”
17576	17581	17585	17585	he	766	“ And would you — ”
17675	17683	17684	17684	she	115	“ Well , thank you so much , ”
17687	17704	17684	17684	she	115	“ How quickly these accidents do happen , and then one returns to the old life ! ”
17705	17710	17711	17711	Anxiety	179	“ I do n’t . ”
17723	17731	17718	17718	His	766	“ I shall probably want to live . ”
17732	17744	17684	17684	she	115	“ But why , Mr. Emerson ? What do you mean ? ”
17745	17755	17782	17783	a family	772	“ I shall want to live , I say . ”
17786	17797	17798	17798	She	115	“ you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn . ”
17945	17950	17923	17924	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Too much Beethoven . ”
18112	18117	18119	18120	the girl	369	“ No , Charlotte ! ”
18126	18148	18119	18120	the girl	369	“ It ’s very kind of Mr. Beebe , but I am certainly coming with you . I had much rather . ”
18149	18155	18157	18158	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Very well , dear , ”
18263	18278	18254	18254	She	114	“ How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this , too ! ”
18295	18322	18286	18286	Charlotte	185	“ Look , Lucia ! Oh , you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party . I feared you would repent you of your choice . ”
18531	18539	18541	18542	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Oh , let me congratulate you ! ”
18544	18556	18541	18542	Miss Bartlett	114	“ After your despair of yesterday ! What a fortunate thing ! ”
18557	18587	18588	18588	Lucy	115	“ Aha ! Miss Honeychurch , come you here I am in luck . Now , you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning . ”
18597	18605	18588	18588	Lucy	115	“ But perhaps you would rather not ? ”
18606	18625	18626	18628	The elder ladies	798	“ I ’m sorry — if you could manage without it , I think I would rather not . ”
18646	18654	18656	18657	Miss Lavish	140	“ It is I who am sorry , ”
18659	18684	18685	18685	She	140	“ We literary hacks are shameless creatures . I believe there ’s no secret of the human heart into which we would n’t pry . ”
18779	18787	18789	18790	Miss Bartlett	114	“ What is the heroine ’s name ? ”
18792	18795	18797	18798	Miss Lavish	140	“ Leonora , ”
18806	18814	18797	18798	Miss Lavish	140	“ I do hope she ’s nice . ”
18822	18829	18797	18798	Miss Lavish	140	“ And what is the plot ? ”
18858	18871	18872	18873	Miss Lavish	140	“ I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this , ”
18876	18941	18872	18873	Miss Lavish	140	“ It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people . Of course , this is the barest outline . There will be a deal of local colouring , descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood , and I shall also introduce some humorous characters . And let me give you all fair warning : I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist . ”
18942	18949	18951	18952	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Oh , you wicked woman , ”
18954	18965	18951	18952	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons . ”
18973	19045	18966	18967	Miss Lavish	140	“ I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen . It is the neglected Italians who attract me , and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can . For I repeat and I insist , and I have always held most strongly , that a tragedy such as yesterday ’s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life . ”
19074	19085	19087	19088	Miss Bartlett	114	“ She is my idea of a really clever woman , ”
19090	19109	19087	19088	Miss Bartlett	114	“ That last remark struck me as so particularly true . It should be a most pathetic novel . ”
19147	19163	19165	19166	Miss Bartlett	114	“ She is emancipated , but only in the very best sense of the word , ”
19169	19226	19165	19166	Miss Bartlett	114	“ None but the superficial would be shocked at her . We had a long talk yesterday . She believes in justice and truth and human interest . She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman — Mr. Eager ! Why , how nice ! What a pleasant surprise ! ”
19227	19234	19236	19237	the chaplain	807	“ Ah , not for me , ”
19240	19256	19236	19237	the chaplain	807	“ for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time . ”
19257	19265	19266	19266	His	807	“ We were chatting to Miss Lavish . ”
19270	19285	19266	19266	His	807	“ So I saw . Were you indeed ? Andate via ! sono occupato ! ”
19305	19434	19435	19436	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I am about to venture a suggestion . Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week — a drive in the hills ? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano . There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour ’s ramble on the hillside . The view thence of Florence is most beautiful — far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole . It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures . That man had a decided feeling for landscape . Decidedly . But who looks at it to - day ? Ah , the world is too much for us . ”
19735	19743	19745	19746	the chaplain	807	“ So we shall be apartie carrée , ”
19748	19792	19745	19746	the chaplain	807	“ In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity . Andate via ! andate presto , presto ! Ah , the town ! Beautiful as it is , it is the town . ”
19796	19836	19745	19746	the chaplain	807	“ This very square — so I am told — witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies . To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration — portentous and humiliating . ”
19837	19841	19843	19844	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Humiliating indeed , ”
19846	19867	19868	19868	She	114	“ Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened . She can hardly bear to speak of it . ”
19874	19884	19886	19887	the chaplain	807	“ And how came we to have you here ? ”
19901	19922	19890	19891	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Do not blame her , please , Mr. Eager . The fault is mine : I left her unchaperoned . ”
19923	19933	19934	19934	His	807	“ So you were here alone , Miss Honeychurch ? ”
19969	19972	19955	19955	His	807	“ Practically . ”
19973	19984	19986	19987	Miss Bartlett	114	“ One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home , ”
19997	20028	19986	19987	Miss Bartlett	114	“ For her also it must have been a terrible experience . I trust that neither of you was at all — that it was not in your immediate proximity ? ”
20068	20078	20080	20080	her	114	“ He died by the fountain , I believe , ”
20083	20090	20080	20080	her	114	“ And you and your friend — ”
20091	20098	20059	20060	George Emerson	119	“ Were over at the Loggia . ”
20099	20153	20174	20174	He	828	“ That must have saved you much . You have not , of course , seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press — This man is a public nuisance ; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well , and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views . ”
20204	20210	20212	20213	the chaplain	807	“ This is too much ! ”
20250	20256	20258	20259	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Willingly would I purchase — ”
20261	20265	20267	20268	Mr. Eager	158	“ Ignore him , ”
20612	20656	20657	20657	They	831	“ The son of a labourer ; I happen to know it for a fact . A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young ; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press . I came across him at Brixton . ”
20664	20673	20675	20676	Miss Bartlett	114	“ How wonderfully people rise in these days ! ”
20688	20691	20693	20694	Mr. Eager	158	“ Generally , ”
20696	20750	20693	20694	Mr. Eager	158	“ one has only sympathy for their success . The desire for education and for social advance — in these things there is something not wholly vile . There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence — little as they would make of it . ”
20751	20758	20759	20760	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Is he a journalist now ? ”
20763	20774	20759	20760	Miss Bartlett	114	“ He is not ; he made an advantageous marriage . ”
20792	20801	20775	20775	He	158	“ Oh , so he has a wife . ”
20802	20876	20759	20760	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Dead , Miss Bartlett , dead . I wonder — yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face , to dare to claim acquaintance with me . He was in my London parish long ago . The other day in Santa Croce , when he was with Miss Honeychurch , I snubbed him . Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub . ”
20877	20880	20882	20882	Lucy	115	“ What ? ”
20886	20889	20891	20892	Mr. Eager	158	“ Exposure ! ”
20950	20955	20956	20956	she	115	“ Do you mean , ”
20959	20972	20956	20956	she	115	“ that he is an irreligious man ? We know that already . ”
20973	20978	20980	20981	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Lucy , dear — ”
20990	21028	20980	20981	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I should be astonished if you knew all . The boy — an innocent child at the time — I will exclude . God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him . ”
21029	21032	21034	21035	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Perhaps , ”
21037	21048	21034	21035	Miss Bartlett	114	“ it is something that we had better not hear . ”
21049	21054	21056	21057	Mr. Eager	158	“ To speak plainly , ”
21059	21069	21056	21057	Mr. Eager	158	“ it is . I will say no more . ”
21091	21098	21111	21111	his	158	“ You have said very little . ”
21099	21109	21111	21111	his	158	“ It was my intention to say very little , ”
21165	21174	21175	21175	he	158	“ Murder , if you want to know , ”
21179	21186	21175	21175	he	158	“ That man murdered his wife ! ”
21187	21190	21191	21191	she	369	“ How ? ”
21194	21217	21191	21191	she	369	“ To all intents and purposes he murdered her . That day in Santa Croce — did they say anything against me ? ”
21218	21231	21175	21175	he	158	“ Not a word , Mr. Eager — not a single word . ”
21232	21260	21175	21175	he	158	“ Oh , I thought they had been libelling me to you . But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them . ”
21261	21268	21270	21270	Lucy	115	“ I ’m not defending them , ”
21284	21291	21270	21270	Lucy	115	“ They ’re nothing to me . ”
21292	21302	21304	21305	Miss Bartlett	114	“ How could you think she was defending them ? ”
21320	21340	21314	21315	The shopman	847	“ She will find it difficult . For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God . ”
21391	21397	21399	21399	he	807	“ I must be going , ”
21427	21439	21440	21440	Lucy	115	“ Drive ? Oh , is our drive to come off ? ”
21460	21465	21467	21468	the girl	369	“ Bother the drive ! ”
21477	21519	21467	21468	the girl	369	“ It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at all . Why should he invite us in that absurd manner ? We might as well invite him . We are each paying for ourselves . ”
21541	21584	21520	21521	Miss Bartlett	114	“ If that is so , dear — if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr. Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe , then I foresee a sad kettle of fish . ”
21585	21588	21467	21468	the girl	369	“ How ? ”
21589	21602	21467	21468	the girl	369	“ Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come , too . ”
21603	21610	21520	21521	Miss Bartlett	114	“ That will mean another carriage . ”
21611	21640	21467	21468	the girl	369	“ Far worse . Mr. Eager does not like Eleanor . She knows it herself . The truth must be told ; she is too unconventional for him . ”
21801	21808	21773	21774	Happy Charlotte	185	“ where things might lead to , ”
21887	21982	21884	21884	she	115	“ Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr. Eager , or Mr. Eager who forgot when he told us , or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogether — which they could scarcely do — but in any case we must be prepared . It is you they really want ; I am only asked for appearances . You shall go with the two gentlemen , and I and Eleanor will follow behind . A one - horse carriage would do for us . Yet how difficult it is ! ”
21983	21988	21990	21991	the girl	369	“ It is indeed , ”
22000	22008	22010	22011	Miss Bartlett	114	“ What do you think about it ? ”
22024	22038	22010	22011	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I do n’t know what I think , nor what I want . ”
22039	22079	22010	22011	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Oh , dear , Lucy ! I do hope Florence is n’t boring you . Speak the word , and , as you know , I would take you to the ends of the earth to - morrow . ”
22080	22086	22088	22088	Lucy	115	“ Thank you , Charlotte , ”
22265	22270	22272	22273	Miss Bartlett	114	“ And the news ? ”
22275	22286	22288	22288	Lucy	115	“ Mrs. Vyse and her son have gone to Rome , ”
22298	22305	22288	22288	Lucy	115	“ Do you know the Vyses ? ”
22306	22326	22272	22273	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Oh , not that way back . We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria . ”
22327	22356	22288	22288	Lucy	115	“ They ’re nice people , the Vyses . So clever — my idea of what ’s really clever . Do n’t you long to be in Rome ? ”
22357	22363	22272	22273	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I die for it ! ”
22495	22498	22500	22501	the girl	369	“ Charlotte ! ”
22504	22560	22500	22501	the girl	369	“ Here ’s an idea . What if we popped off to Rome to - morrow — straight to the Vyses ’ hotel ? For I do know what I want . I ’m sick of Florence . No , you said you ’d go to the ends of the earth ! Do ! Do ! ”
22570	22589	22561	22562	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Oh , you droll person ! Pray , what would become of your drive in the hills ? ”
23313	23329	23299	23300	Mr. Eager	158	“ So , Miss Honeychurch , you are travelling ? As a student of art ? ”
23330	23342	23299	23300	Mr. Eager	158	“ Oh , dear me , no — oh , no ! ”
23343	23352	23354	23355	Miss Lavish	140	“ Perhaps as a student of human nature , ”
23357	23361	23354	23355	Miss Lavish	140	“ like myself ? ”
23362	23374	23299	23300	Mr. Eager	158	“ Oh , no . I am here as a tourist . ”
23375	23380	23382	23383	Mr. Eager	158	“ Oh , indeed , ”
23385	23534	23382	23383	Mr. Eager	158	“ Are you indeed ? If you will not think me rude , we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little — handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence , from Florence to Rome , living herded together in pensions or hotels , quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker , their one anxiety to get ‘ done ’ or ‘ through ’ and go on somewhere else . The result is , they mix up towns , rivers , palaces in one inextricable whirl . You know the American girl in Punch who says : ‘ Say , poppa , what did we see at Rome ? ’ And the father replies : ‘ Why , guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog . ’ There ’s travelling for you . Ha ! ha ! ha ! ”
23535	23540	23542	23543	Miss Lavish	140	“ I quite agree , ”
23556	23574	23542	23543	Miss Lavish	140	“ The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo - Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace . ”
23575	23716	23382	23383	Mr. Eager	158	“ Quite so . Now , the English colony at Florence , Miss Honeychurch — and it is of considerable size , though , of course , not all equally — a few are here for trade , for example . But the greater part are students . Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico . I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left . No , you can only see it if you stand — no , do not stand ; you will fall . She is very proud of that thick hedge . Inside , perfect seclusion . One might have gone back six hundred years . Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron , which lends it an additional interest , does it not ? ”
23717	23722	23724	23725	Miss Lavish	140	“ It does indeed ! ”
23727	23743	23724	23725	Miss Lavish	140	“ Tell me , where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day ? ”
23780	23876	23771	23773	the Somebody Elses	920	“ Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ‘ Mediæval Byways ’ ? He is working at Gemistus Pletho . Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear , over the wall , the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot , dusty , unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘ do ’ Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there , and I think — think — I think how little they think what lies so near them . ”
23947	23952	23954	23955	Mr. Eager	158	“ Piano ! piano ! ”
23965	23977	23979	23980	the driver	2219	“ Va bene , signore , va bene , va bene , ”
24058	24063	24065	24065	he	119	“ Piano ! piano ! ”
24147	24153	24155	24155	he	119	“ She is my sister , ”
24253	24262	24263	24263	she	140	“ Most certainly I would let them be , ”
24266	24297	24263	24263	she	140	“ But I dare say I shall receive scant support . I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life . This is whatIcall an adventure . ”
24298	24304	24306	24307	Mr. Eager	158	“ We must not submit , ”
24309	24333	24306	24307	Mr. Eager	158	“ I knew he was trying it on . He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook ’s tourists . ”
24334	24338	24340	24341	Miss Lavish	140	“ Surely no ! ”
24376	24381	24357	24359	sensible Mr. Beebe	120	“ Leave them alone , ”
24396	24445	24385	24386	the chaplain	807	“ Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there ? To be driven by lovers — A king might envy us , and if we part them it ’s more like sacrilege than anything I know . ”
24560	24563	24565	24566	the man	2409	“ Signorina ! ”
24583	24586	24590	24590	her	193	“ Signorina ! ”
24622	24627	24629	24630	Mr. Eager	158	“ Victory at last ! ”
24642	24648	24650	24651	Mr. Emerson	119	“ It is not victory , ”
24653	24667	24650	24651	Mr. Emerson	119	“ It is defeat . You have parted two people who were happy . ”
24723	24758	24715	24715	he	346	“ We have tried to buy what can not be bought with money . He has bargained to drive us , and he is doing it . We have no rights over his soul . ”
24781	24789	24790	24790	she	140	“ He was not driving us well , ”
24793	24798	24790	24790	she	140	“ He jolted us . ”
24799	24871	24872	24873	Miss Lavish	140	“ That I deny . It was as restful as sleeping . Aha ! he is jolting us now . Can you wonder ? He would like to throw us out , and most certainly he is justified . And if I were superstitious I ’d be frightened of the girl , too . It does n’t do to injure young people . Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici ? ”
24876	24910	24872	24873	Miss Lavish	140	“ Most certainly I have . Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico , or to Lorenzo , Duke of Urbino , or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature ? ”
24911	24954	24872	24873	Miss Lavish	140	“ The Lord knows . Possibly he does know , for I refer to Lorenzo the poet . He wrote a line — so I heard yesterday — which runs like this : ‘ Do n’t go fighting against the Spring . ’ ”
24965	24972	24973	24973	he	158	“ Non fate guerra al Maggio , ”
24976	24990	24973	24973	he	158	“ ‘ War not with the May ’ would render a correct meaning . ”
24991	25004	25005	25005	He	158	“ The point is , we have warred with it . Look . ”
25024	25080	25005	25005	He	158	“ Fifty miles of Spring , and we ’ve come up to admire them . Do you suppose there ’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man ? But there we go , praising the one and condemning the other as improper , ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both . ”
25443	25447	25440	25440	he	119	“ the railway . ”
25505	25509	25511	25512	Miss Lavish	140	“ The railway ! ”
25514	25529	25511	25512	Miss Lavish	140	“ Oh , but I shall die ! Of course it was the railway ! ”
25537	25554	25530	25530	She	140	“ He is the image of a porter — on , on the South - Eastern . ”
25555	25561	25511	25512	Miss Lavish	140	“ Eleanor , be quiet , ”
25568	25578	25511	25512	Miss Lavish	140	“ Hush ! They ’ll hear — the Emersons — ”
25579	25595	25530	25530	She	140	“ I ca n’t stop . Let me go my wicked way . A porter — ”
25596	25599	25511	25512	Miss Lavish	140	“ Eleanor ! ”
25600	25609	25511	25512	Miss Lavish	140	“ I ’m sure it ’s all right , ”
25614	25630	25511	25512	Miss Lavish	140	“ The Emersons wo n’t hear , and they would n’t mind if they did . ”
25640	25645	25646	25646	she	140	“ Miss Honeychurch listening ! ”
25651	25663	25646	25646	she	140	“ Pouf ! Wouf ! You naughty girl ! Go away ! ”
25664	25681	25511	25512	Miss Lavish	140	“ Oh , Lucy , you ought to be with Mr. Eager , I ’m sure . ”
25682	25698	25511	25512	Miss Lavish	140	“ I ca n’t find them now , and I do n’t want to either . ”
25699	25711	25646	25646	she	140	“ Mr. Eager will be offended . It is your party . ”
25712	25723	25511	25512	Miss Lavish	140	“ Please , I ’d rather stop here with you . ”
25724	25730	25732	25733	Miss Lavish	140	“ No , I agree , ”
25735	25772	25732	25733	Miss Lavish	140	“ It ’s like a school feast ; the boys have got separated from the girls . Miss Lucy , you are to go . We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear . ”
25841	25847	25849	25850	Miss Bartlett	114	“ How tired one gets , ”
25852	25866	25849	25850	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Oh , I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here . ”
25900	25906	25908	25909	Miss Lavish	140	“ Then sit you down , ”
25911	25916	25908	25909	Miss Lavish	140	“ Observe my foresight . ”
25956	26012	26013	26013	She	140	“ Lucy ; without a moment ’s doubt , Lucy . The ground will do for me . Really I have not had rheumatism for years . If I do feel it coming on I shall stand . Imagine your mother ’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen . ”
26024	26066	26067	26067	She	140	“ Here we are , all settled delightfully . Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much , being brown . Sit down , dear ; you are too unselfish ; you do n’t assert yourself enough . ”
26072	26110	26069	26069	her	140	“ Now do n’t be alarmed ; this is n’t a cold . It ’s the tiniest cough , and I have had it three days . It ’s nothing to do with sitting here at all . ”
26194	26197	26199	26199	Lucy	115	“ Dove ? ”
26275	26277	26241	26241	He	987	“ clergyman ”
26279	26284	26286	26286	she	115	“ Dove buoni uomini ? ”
26306	26313	26300	26300	He	987	“ Uno — piu — piccolo , ”
26320	26340	26300	26300	He	987	“ Has the cigar been given to you by Mr. Beebe , the smaller of the two good men ? ”
26519	26527	26500	26500	His	987	“ would she like to see them ? ”
26528	26533	26534	26534	He	987	“ Ma buoni uomini . ”
26626	26631	26652	26652	He	987	“ What is that ? ”
26703	26706	26707	26707	he	987	“ Eccolo ! ”
26756	26759	26761	26762	her companion	1009	“ Courage ! ”
26771	26776	26777	26777	She	115	“ Courage and love . ”
26967	26974	26983	26984	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Lucy ! Lucy ! Lucy ! ”
27211	27217	27218	27218	he	192	“ Let us go immediately , ”
27222	27228	27218	27218	he	192	“ The signorino will walk . ”
27229	27239	27241	27242	Mr. Beebe	120	“ All the way ? He will be hours , ”
27244	27254	27255	27255	He	192	“ Apparently . I told him it was unwise . ”
27568	27623	27562	27563	Mr. Eager	158	“ Courage , Miss Honeychurch , courage and faith . If I might say so , there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements . Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds , all this immense electrical display , is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me ? ”
27624	27630	27562	27563	Mr. Eager	158	“ No — of course — ”
27631	27687	27562	27563	Mr. Eager	158	“ Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous . The steel knives , the only articles which might attract the current , are in the other carriage . And , in any case , we are infinitely safer than if we were walking . Courage — courage and faith . ”
27773	27777	27779	27780	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Mr. Eager ! ”
27782	27794	27779	27780	Mr. Beebe	120	“ We want your assistance . Will you interpret for us ? ”
27795	27798	27800	27801	Mr. Emerson	119	“ George ! ”
27803	27824	27800	27801	Mr. Emerson	119	“ Ask your driver which way George went . The boy may lose his way . He may be killed . ”
27825	27831	27833	27834	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Go , Mr. Eager , ”
27836	27862	27833	27834	Miss Bartlett	114	“ do n’t ask our driver ; our driver is no help . Go and support poor Mr. Beebe — , he is nearly demented . ”
27863	27869	27871	27873	the old man	346	“ He may be killed ! ”
27875	27881	27871	27873	the old man	346	“ He may be killed ! ”
27882	27886	27888	27889	the chaplain	807	“ Typical behaviour , ”
27897	27911	27892	27892	he	807	“ In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down . ”
27912	27918	27920	27920	Lucy	115	“ What does he know ? ”
27928	27938	27920	27920	Lucy	115	“ Charlotte , how much does Mr. Eager know ? ”
27939	27950	27951	27951	she	115	“ Nothing , dearest ; he knows nothing . But — ”
27955	27967	27968	27968	She	115	driver—“heknows everything . Dearest , had we better ? Shall I ? ”
27974	27992	28003	28003	she	115	“ It is dreadful to be entangled with low - class people . He saw it all . ”
28006	28009	28003	28003	she	115	“ Silenzio ! ”
28016	28020	28021	28021	he	1049	“ Va bene , ”
28236	28271	28228	28228	Lucy	115	“ Charlotte , dear Charlotte , kiss me . Kiss me again . Only you can understand me . You warned me to be careful . And I — I thought I was developing . ”
28272	28283	28206	28207	the drivers	974	“ Do not cry , dearest . Take your time . ”
28284	28322	28228	28228	Lucy	115	“ I have been obstinate and silly — worse than you know , far worse . Once by the river — Oh , but he is n’t killed — he would n’t be killed , would he ? ”
28361	28373	28352	28352	she	1062	“ I trust not . One would always pray against that . ”
28374	28464	28228	28228	Lucy	115	“ He is really — I think he was taken by surprise , just as I was before . But this time I ’m not to blame ; I want you to believe that . I simply slipped into those violets . No , I want to be really truthful . I am a little to blame . I had silly thoughts . The sky , you know , was gold , and the ground all blue , and for a moment he looked like someone in a book . ”
28465	28470	28554	28554	she	115	“ In a book ? ”
28471	28481	28228	28228	Lucy	115	“ Heroes — gods — the nonsense of schoolgirls . ”
28482	28486	28228	28228	Lucy	115	“ And then ? ”
28487	28498	28554	28554	she	115	“ But , Charlotte , you know what happened then . ”
28546	28553	28554	28554	she	115	“ I want to be truthful , ”
28557	28567	28554	28554	she	115	“ It is so hard to be absolutely truthful . ”
28568	28595	28554	28554	she	115	“ Do n’t be troubled , dearest . Wait till you are calmer . We will talk it over before bed - time in my room . ”
28744	28748	28750	28750	she	369	“ At last , ”
28752	28780	28750	28750	she	369	“ I shall understand myself . I sha n’t again be troubled by things that come out of nothing , and mean I do n’t know what . ”
28889	28919	28882	28882	her	114	“ Well , dear , I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire . Come into my room , and I will give a good brush to your hair . ”
28941	28949	28938	28939	Miss Bartlett	114	“ So what is to be done ? ”
28985	29003	28980	28980	she	369	“ What is to be done ? A point , dearest , which you alone can settle . ”
29095	29105	29106	29106	she	115	“ It has been raining for nearly four hours , ”
29117	29126	29111	29112	Miss Bartlett	114	“ How do you propose to silence him ? ”
29127	29131	29072	29072	She	115	“ The driver ? ”
29132	29143	29144	29144	Lucy	115	“ My dear girl , no ; Mr. George Emerson . ”
29154	29160	29161	29161	she	115	“ I do n’t understand , ”
29181	29193	29161	29161	she	115	“ How are you going to stop him talking about it ? ”
29194	29209	29072	29072	She	115	“ I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do . ”
29210	29238	29161	29161	she	115	“ I , too , intend to judge him charitably . But unfortunately I have met the type before . They seldom keep their exploits to themselves . ”
29239	29242	29244	29244	Lucy	115	“ Exploits ? ”
29252	29308	29244	29244	Lucy	115	“ My poor dear , did you suppose that this was his first ? Come here and listen to me . I am only gathering it from his own remarks . Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another ? ”
29309	29312	29314	29314	Lucy	115	“ Yes , ”
29325	29385	29314	29314	Lucy	115	“ Well , I am no prude . There is no need to call him a wicked young man , but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined . Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education , if you wish . But we are no farther on with our question . What do you propose to do ? ”
29414	29422	29424	29424	she	115	“ I propose to speak to him , ”
29435	29465	29426	29427	Miss Bartlett	114	“ You see , Charlotte , your kindness — I shall never forget it . But — as you said — it is my affair . Mine and his . ”
29466	29478	29609	29609	her	115	“ And you are going toimplorehim , tobeghim to keep silence ? ”
29479	29521	29609	29609	her	115	“ Certainly not . There would be no difficulty . Whatever you ask him he answers , yes or no ; then it is over . I have been frightened of him . But now I am not one little bit . ”
29522	29595	29609	29609	her	115	“ But we fear him for you , dear . You are so young and inexperienced , you have lived among such nice people , that you can not realize what men can be — how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round . This afternoon , for example , if I had not arrived , what would have happened ? ”
29596	29602	29604	29604	Lucy	115	“ I ca n’t think , ”
29623	29634	29609	29609	her	115	“ What would have happened if I had n’t arrived ? ”
29635	29641	29643	29643	Lucy	115	“ I ca n’t think , ”
29646	29658	29643	29643	Lucy	115	“ When he insulted you , how would you have replied ? ”
29659	29670	29609	29609	her	115	“ I had n’t time to think . You came . ”
29671	29687	29609	29609	her	115	“ Yes , but wo n’t you tell me now what you would have done ? ”
29688	29693	29694	29694	She	115	“ I should have — ”
29729	29738	29740	29741	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Come away from the window , dear , ”
29743	29752	29740	29741	Miss Bartlett	114	“ You will be seen from the road . ”
29812	29892	29807	29808	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Oh , for a real man ! We are only two women , you and I. Mr. Beebe is hopeless . There is Mr. Eager , but you do not trust him . Oh , for your brother ! He is young , but I know that his sister ’s insult would rouse in him a very lion . Thank God , chivalry is not yet dead . There are still left some men who can reverence woman . ”
29926	29943	29918	29918	she	114	“ It will be a push to catch the morning train , but we must try . ”
29944	29948	29918	29918	she	114	“ What train ? ”
29949	29955	29956	29956	She	114	“ The train to Rome . ”
29976	29985	29918	29918	she	114	“ When does the train to Rome go ? ”
29986	29990	29956	29956	She	114	“ At eight . ”
29991	29998	29956	29956	She	114	“ Signora Bertolini would be upset . ”
29999	30005	30007	30008	Miss Bartlett	114	“ We must face that , ”
30021	30034	30015	30015	she	114	“ She will make us pay for a whole week ’s pension . ”
30035	30064	29956	29956	She	114	“ I expect she will . However , we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses ’ hotel . Is n’t afternoon tea given there for nothing ? ”
30065	30075	30015	30015	she	114	“ Yes , but they pay extra for wine . ”
30356	30367	30348	30348	she	185	“ Dearest Lucy , how will you ever forgive me ? ”
30401	30418	30398	30398	she	115	“ Charlotte dear , what do you mean ? As if I have anything to forgive ! ”
30419	30451	30398	30398	she	115	“ You have a great deal , and I have a very great deal to forgive myself , too . I know well how much I vex you at every turn . ”
30452	30456	30398	30398	she	115	“ But no — ”
30471	30531	30398	30398	she	115	“ Ah , but yes ! I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped . I might have known it would not do . You want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you . I am too uninteresting and old - fashioned — only fit to pack and unpack your things . ”
30532	30535	30398	30398	she	115	“ Please — ”
30536	30602	30654	30654	she	114	“ My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste , and were often able to leave me at home . I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do , but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary . You had your own way about these rooms , at all events . ”
30603	30611	30613	30613	Lucy	115	“ You must n’t say these things , ”
30641	30648	30654	30654	she	114	“ I have been a failure , ”
30669	30702	30654	30654	she	114	“ Failed to make you happy ; failed in my duty to your mother . She has been so generous to me ; I shall never face her again after this disaster . ”
30703	30726	30654	30654	she	114	“ But mother will understand . It is not your fault , this trouble , and it is n’t a disaster either . ”
30727	30761	30654	30654	she	114	“ It is my fault , it is a disaster . She will never forgive me , and rightly . For instance , what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish ? ”
30762	30766	30654	30654	she	114	“ Every right . ”
30767	30807	30654	30654	she	114	“ When I was here for your sake ? If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you . Your mother will see this as clearly as I do , when you tell her . ”
30821	30829	30808	30808	Lucy	115	“ Why need mother hear of it ? ”
30830	30837	30654	30654	she	114	“ But you tell her everything ? ”
30838	30845	30654	30654	she	114	“ I suppose I do generally . ”
30846	30875	30654	30654	she	114	“ I dare not break your confidence . There is something sacred in it . Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her . ”
30885	30931	30932	30932	Her	369	“ Naturally I should have told her . But in case she should blame you in any way , I promise I will not , I am very willing not to . I will never speak of it either to her or to any one . ”
31360	31378	31356	31356	her	114	“ I wish one word with you in the drawing - room , Mr. Emerson , please . ”
31389	31397	31385	31386	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Good - night , Mr. Emerson . ”
31419	31446	31415	31415	Lucy	115	“ It is n’t true . It ca n’t all be true . I want not to be muddled . I want to grow older quickly . ”
31454	31472	31447	31448	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Go to bed at once , dear . You need all the rest you can get . ”
31542	31552	31531	31532	A poet	1113	“ Life like a dome of many coloured glass , ”
31716	31722	31724	31725	the boy	759	“ Where are n’t they ? ”
31735	31745	31724	31725	the boy	759	“ I tell you I ’m getting fairly sick . ”
31746	31761	31763	31764	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ For goodness ’ sake go out of my drawing - room , then ? ”
31786	31796	31797	31797	she	163	“ I think things are coming to a head , ”
31818	31823	31797	31797	she	163	“ Time they did . ”
31824	31837	31797	31797	she	163	“ I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more . ”
31838	31849	31797	31797	she	163	“ It ’s his third go , is n’t it ? ”
31850	31861	31797	31797	she	163	“ Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind . ”
31862	31871	31873	31873	he	129	“ I did n’t mean to be unkind . ”
31876	31940	31873	31873	he	129	“ But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy . I do n’t know how girls manage things , but she ca n’t have said ‘ No ’ properly before , or she would n’t have to say it again now . Over the whole thing — I ca n’t explain — I do feel so uncomfortable . ”
31941	31951	31797	31797	she	163	“ Do you indeed , dear ? How interesting ! ”
31952	31959	31960	31960	He	129	“ I feel — never mind . ”
31966	31987	31960	31960	He	129	“ Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse . I said : ‘ Dear Mrs. Vyse . ’ ”
31988	32002	31797	31797	she	163	“ Yes , mother , you told me . A jolly good letter . ”
32003	32035	32036	32036	She	1124	“ I said : ‘ Dear Mrs. Vyse , Cecil has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted , if Lucy wishes it . But — ’ ”
32040	32084	32036	32036	She	1124	“ I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all . He has always gone in for unconventionality , and parents nowhere , and so forth . When it comes to the point , he ca n’t get on without me . ”
32085	32089	31797	31797	she	163	“ Nor me . ”
32090	32093	32094	32094	Freddy	129	“ You ? ”
32097	32103	32094	32094	Freddy	129	“ What do you mean ? ”
32104	32113	32114	32114	She	1124	“ He asked me for my permission also . ”
32117	32124	32114	32114	She	1124	“ How very odd of him ! ”
32125	32129	32131	32132	the son	353	“ Why so ? ”
32136	32145	32131	32132	the son	353	“ Why should n’t my permission be asked ? ”
32146	32164	32094	32094	Freddy	129	“ What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything ? What ever did you say ? ”
32165	32186	32114	32114	She	1124	“ I said to Cecil , ‘ Take her or leave her ; it ’s no business of mine ! ’ ”
32187	32193	32094	32094	Freddy	129	“ What a helpful answer ! ”
32213	32219	32221	32221	Freddy	129	“ The bother is this , ”
32248	32260	32240	32241	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Freddy , you must come . There they still are ! ”
32261	32274	32240	32241	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ I do n’t see you ought to go peeping like that . ”
32275	32290	32292	32292	she	163	“ Peeping like that ! Ca n’t I look out of my own window ? ”
32308	32313	32292	32292	she	163	“ Still page 322 ? ”
32349	32367	32368	32368	He	2491	“ The bother is this : I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully . ”
32374	32460	32368	32368	He	2491	“ Not content with ‘ permission ’ , which I did give — that is to say , I said , ‘ I do n’t mind’—well , not content with that , he wanted to know whether I was n’t off my head with joy . He practically put it like this : Was n’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her ? And he would have an answer — he said it would strengthen his hand . ”
32461	32472	32528	32529	his mother	1119	“ I hope you gave a careful answer , dear . ”
32473	32479	32481	32482	the boy	759	“ I answered ‘ No ’ ”
32488	32521	32481	32482	the boy	759	“ There ! Fly into a stew ! I ca n’t help it — had to say it . I had to say no . He ought never to have asked me . ”
32522	32526	32528	32529	his mother	1119	“ Ridiculous child ! ”
32531	32580	32528	32529	his mother	1119	“ You think you ’re so holy and truthful , but really it ’s only abominable conceit . Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say ? I hope he boxed your ears . How dare you say no ? ”
32581	32658	32481	32482	the boy	759	“ Oh , do keep quiet , mother ! I had to say no when I could n’t say yes . I tried to laugh as if I did n’t mean what I said , and , as Cecil laughed too , and went away , it may be all right . But I feel my foot ’s in it . Oh , do keep quiet , though , and let a man do some work . ”
32659	32662	32664	32665	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ No , ”
32678	32721	32664	32665	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ I shall not keep quiet . You know all that has passed between them in Rome ; you know why he is down here , and yet you deliberately insult him , and try to turn him out of my house . ”
32722	32727	32728	32728	he	1132	“ Not a bit ! ”
32731	32765	32728	32728	he	1132	“ I only let out I did n’t like him . I do n’t hate him , but I do n’t like him . What I mind is that he ’ll tell Lucy . ”
32773	32779	32781	32782	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Well , Ilike him , ”
32784	32834	32835	32835	She	163	“ I know his mother ; he ’s good , he ’s clever , he ’s rich , he ’s well connected — Oh , you need n’t kick the piano ! He ’s well connected — I’ll say it again if you like : he ’s well connected . ”
32853	32860	32850	32850	She	163	“ And he has beautiful manners . ”
32861	32896	32903	32904	his mother	1119	“ I liked him till just now . I suppose it ’s having him spoiling Lucy ’s first week at home ; and it ’s also something that Mr. Beebe said , not knowing . ”
32897	32901	32909	32909	her	1119	“ Mr. Beebe ? ”
32912	32923	32909	32909	her	1119	“ I do n’t see how Mr. Beebe comes in . ”
32924	33016	32903	32904	his mother	1119	“ You know Mr. Beebe ’s funny way , when you never quite know what he means . He said : ‘ Mr. Vyse is an ideal bachelor . ’ I was very cute , I asked him what he meant . He said ‘ Oh , he ’s like me — better detached . ’ I could n’t make him say any more , but it set me thinking . Since Cecil has come after Lucy he has n’t been so pleasant , at least — I ca n’t explain . ”
33017	33043	32903	32904	his mother	1119	“ You never can , dear . But I can . You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties . ”
33143	33148	33150	33151	his mother	1119	“ Will this do ? ”
33153	33287	33150	33151	his mother	1119	“ ‘ Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it . ’ Then I put in at the top , ‘ and I have told Lucy so . ’ I must write the letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so . But Lucy seems very uncertain , and in these days young people must decide for themselves . ’ I said that because I did n’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old - fashioned . She goes in for lectures and improving her mind , and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds , and the maid ’s dirty thumb - marks where you turn on the electric light . She keeps that flat abominably — ”
33288	33306	33150	33151	his mother	1119	“ Suppose Lucy marries Cecil , would she live in a flat , or in the country ? ”
33307	33389	33150	33151	his mother	1119	“ Do n’t interrupt so foolishly . Where was I ? Oh yes—‘Young people must decide for themselves . I know that Lucy likes your son , because she tells me everything , and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first . ’ No , I ’ll cross that last bit out — it looks patronizing . I ’ll stop at ‘ because she tells me everything . ’ Or shall I cross that out , too ? ”
33390	33397	33399	33399	Freddy	129	“ Cross it out , too , ”
33407	33481	33401	33402	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Then the whole thing runs : ‘ Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it , and I have told Lucy so . But Lucy seems very uncertain , and in these days young people must decide for themselves . I know that Lucy likes your son , because she tells me everything . But I do not know — ’ ”
33482	33486	33488	33488	Freddy	129	“ Look out ! ”
33804	33809	33810	33810	she	163	“ Oh , Cecil ! ”
33811	33819	33788	33789	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	exclaimed—“oh , Cecil , do tell me ! ”
33820	33825	33827	33827	he	210	“ I promessi sposi , ”
33835	33841	33842	33842	he	210	“ She has accepted me , ”
33866	33872	33874	33875	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ I am so glad , ”
33936	33944	33946	33947	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Welcome as one of the family ! ”
33956	33976	33950	33950	her	163	“ This is indeed a joyous day ! I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy . ”
33977	33982	33984	33986	the young man	381	“ I hope so , ”
33995	33999	34001	34002	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ We mothers — ”
34047	34053	34055	34055	Cecil	210	“ I say , Lucy ! ”
34116	34120	34113	34113	He	866	“ Steady on ! ”
34121	34128	34130	34131	her mother	484	“ Not a kiss for me ? ”
34138	34154	34155	34155	Cecil	210	“ Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it ? ”
34158	34169	34155	34155	Cecil	210	“ And I ’d stop here and tell my mother . ”
34170	34176	34178	34178	Freddy	129	“ We go with Lucy ? ”
34185	34193	34178	34178	Freddy	129	“ Yes , you go with Lucy . ”
34448	34451	34452	34452	She	115	“ story . ”
34732	34737	34722	34722	he	210	“ Dear Mrs. Vyse , ”
34956	34962	34963	34963	he	210	Freddy—“He is only a boy , ”
34966	34987	34963	34963	he	210	“ I represent all that he despises . Why should he want me for a brother - in - law ? ”
35032	35036	35038	35039	the maid	2649	“ Mr. Beebe ! ”
35080	35099	35074	35074	Cecil	210	“ I ’ve come for tea , Mr. Vyse . Do you suppose that I shall get it ? ”
35100	35130	35159	35159	Cecil	210	“ I should say so . Food is the thing one does get here — Don’t sit in that chair ; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it . ”
35131	35134	35074	35074	Cecil	210	“ Pfui ! ”
35135	35139	35141	35141	Cecil	210	“ I know , ”
35143	35157	35141	35141	Cecil	210	“ I know . I ca n’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it . ”
35190	35205	35179	35179	they	1185	“ I ’ve come for tea and for gossip . Is n’t this news ? ”
35206	35215	35217	35217	Cecil	210	“ News ? I do n’t understand you , ”
35219	35222	35217	35217	Cecil	210	“ News ? ”
35238	35273	35223	35224	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up ; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field . He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack ! ”
35274	35279	35281	35281	Cecil	210	“ Has he indeed ? ”
35343	35386	35340	35341	a bounder	1190	“ Unpardonable question ! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert , the semi - detached villas that have been run up opposite the church ! I ’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you . ”
35387	35396	35398	35400	the young man	381	“ I ’m shockingly stupid over local affairs , ”
35403	35476	35398	35400	the young man	381	“ I ca n’t even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board . Perhaps there is no difference , or perhaps those are n’t the right names . I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery . It is very remiss of me . Italy and London are the only places where I do n’t feel to exist on sufferance . ”
35496	35512	35477	35478	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Let me see , Mr. Vyse — I forget — what is your profession ? ”
35513	35519	35521	35521	Cecil	210	“ I have no profession , ”
35523	35598	35521	35521	Cecil	210	“ It is another example of my decadence . My attitude — quite an indefensible one — is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like . I know I ought to be getting money out of people , or devoting myself to things I do n’t care a straw about , but somehow , I ’ve not been able to begin . ”
35599	35605	35607	35608	Mr. Beebe	120	“ You are very fortunate , ”
35610	35622	35607	35608	Mr. Beebe	120	“ It is a wonderful opportunity , the possession of leisure . ”
35660	35682	35641	35641	He	120	“ I am glad that you approve . I dare n’t face the healthy person — for example , Freddy Honeychurch . ”
35683	35696	35641	35641	He	120	“ Oh , Freddy ’s a good sort , is n’t he ? ”
35697	35710	35714	35714	himself	210	“ Admirable . The sort who has made England what she is . ”
35776	35782	35784	35785	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Where are the others ? ”
35789	35799	35784	35785	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I insist on extracting tea before evening service . ”
35800	35877	35757	35757	he	210	“ I suppose Anne never told them you were here . In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives . The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly , and kicks the chair - legs with her feet . The faults of Mary — I forget the faults of Mary , but they are very grave . Shall we look in the garden ? ”
35878	35897	35784	35785	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I know the faults of Mary . She leaves the dust - pans standing on the stairs . ”
35898	35919	35920	35920	They	1198	“ The fault of Euphemia is that she will not , simply will not , chop the suet sufficiently small . ”
35931	35937	35938	35938	Cecil	210	“ The faults of Freddy — ”
35941	35973	35938	35938	Cecil	210	“ Ah , he has too many . No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy . Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch ; they are not innumerable . ”
35974	35979	35981	35983	the young man	381	“ She has none , ”
35989	36000	35981	35983	the young man	381	“ I quite agree . At present she has none . ”
36001	36005	35938	35938	Cecil	210	“ At present ? ”
36006	36092	36093	36093	Cecil	210	“ I ’m not cynical . I ’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch . Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully , and live so quietly ? I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both . The water - tight compartments in her will break down , and music and life will mingle . Then we shall have her heroically good , heroically bad — too heroic , perhaps , to be good or bad . ”
36099	36114	36093	36093	Cecil	210	“ And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes ? ”
36115	36199	35938	35938	Cecil	210	“ Well , I must say I ’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells , where she was not wonderful , and at Florence . Since I came to Summer Street she has been away . You saw her , did n’t you , at Rome and in the Alps . Oh , I forgot ; of course , you knew her before . No , she was n’t wonderful in Florence either , but I kept on expecting that she would be . ”
36200	36205	36093	36093	Cecil	210	“ In what way ? ”
36223	36286	36214	36214	they	1201	“ I could as easily tell you what tune she ’ll play next . There was simply the sense that she had found wings , and meant to use them . I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary : Miss Honeychurch as a kite , Miss Bartlett holding the string . Picture number two : the string breaks . ”
36320	36327	36310	36310	he	1203	“ But the string never broke ? ”
36328	36350	36359	36361	the young man	381	“ No . I might n’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise , but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall . ”
36351	36357	36359	36361	the young man	381	“ It has broken now , ”
36415	36423	36398	36398	he	1203	“ Broken ? What do you mean ? ”
36424	36428	36430	36430	Cecil	210	“ I meant , ”
36433	36442	36430	36430	Cecil	210	“ that she is going to marry me . ”
36461	36503	36452	36452	he	368	“ I am sorry ; I must apologize . I had no idea you were intimate with her , or I should never have talked in this flippant , superficial way . Mr. Vyse , you ought to have stopped me . ”
36593	36604	36605	36605	he	210	“ I am sorry I have given you a shock , ”
36609	36623	36605	36605	he	210	“ I fear that Lucy ’s choice does not meet with your approval . ”
36624	36666	36605	36605	he	210	“ Not that . But you ought to have stopped me . I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes . Perhaps I ought n’t to have discussed her so freely with any one ; certainly not with you . ”
36667	36677	36678	36679	Mr. Beebe	120	“ You are conscious of having said something indiscreet ? ”
36711	36797	36700	36700	He	213	“ No , I have said nothing indiscreet . I foresaw at Florence that her quiet , uneventful childhood must end , and it has ended . I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step . She has taken it . She has learnt — you will let me talk freely , as I have begun freely — she has learnt what it is to love : the greatest lesson , some people will tell you , that our earthly life provides . ”
36821	36828	36831	36831	his	213	“ She has learnt through you , ”
36843	36857	36831	36831	his	213	“ let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her . ”
36858	36862	36864	36864	Cecil	210	“ Grazie tante ! ”
36872	36877	36882	36882	she	163	“ Have you heard ? ”
36889	36901	36882	36882	she	163	“ Oh , Mr. Beebe , have you heard the news ? ”
36921	36926	36927	36927	he	129	“ Indeed I have ! ”
36954	37027	36938	36938	he	129	“ Mrs. Honeychurch , I ’m going to do what I am always supposed to do , but generally I ’m too shy . I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them , grave and gay , great and small . I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife , as father and mother . And now I want my tea . ”
37028	37038	37039	37040	the lady	1213	“ You only asked for it just in time , ”
37043	37053	37039	37040	the lady	1213	“ How dare you be serious at Windy Corner ? ”
37348	37349	37337	37337	Freddy	129	“ Fiasco”—family
37596	37608	37609	37609	he	210	“ Do you go to much of this sort of thing ? ”
37617	37624	37626	37626	Lucy	115	“ Oh , now and then , ”
37634	37642	37626	37626	Lucy	115	“ Is it typical of country society ? ”
37643	37654	37685	37685	Cecil	210	“ I suppose so . Mother , would it be ? ”
37655	37660	37662	37663	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Plenty of society , ”
37692	37704	37685	37685	Cecil	210	“ To me it seemed perfectly appalling , disastrous , portentous . ”
37705	37715	37685	37685	Cecil	210	“ I am so sorry that you were stranded . ”
37716	37759	37685	37685	Cecil	210	“ Not that , but the congratulations . It is so disgusting , the way an engagement is regarded as public property — a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment . All those old women smirking ! ”
37760	37781	37685	37685	Cecil	210	“ One has to go through it , I suppose . They wo n’t notice us so much next time . ”
37782	37816	37685	37685	Cecil	210	“ But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong . An engagement — horrid word in the first place — is a private matter , and should be treated as such . ”
37886	37890	37891	37891	she	115	“ How tiresome ! ”
37894	37903	37891	37891	she	115	“ Could n’t you have escaped to tennis ? ”
37904	37942	37960	37960	She	115	“ I do n’t play tennis — at least , not in public . The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic . Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato . ”
37943	37947	37960	37960	She	115	“ Inglese Italianato ? ”
37948	37959	37891	37891	she	115	“ E un diavolo incarnato ! You know the proverb ? ”
38006	38009	38011	38011	he	210	“ Well , ”
38013	38042	38011	38011	he	210	“ I can not help it if they do disapprove of me . There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them , and I must accept them . ”
38043	38053	38055	38056	wise Lucy	115	“ We all have our limitations , I suppose , ”
38058	38068	38070	38070	Cecil	210	“ Sometimes they are forced on us , though , ”
38086	38089	38078	38078	she	115	“ How ? ”
38090	38118	38119	38119	She	115	“ It makes a difference does n’t it , whether we fully fence ourselves in , or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others ? ”
38133	38136	38138	38139	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Difference ? ”
38144	38165	38138	38139	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ I do n’t see any difference . Fences are fences , especially when they are in the same place . ”
38166	38173	38175	38175	Cecil	210	“ We were speaking of motives , ”
38183	38191	38192	38192	She	115	“ My dear Cecil , look here . ”
38207	38239	38192	38192	She	115	“ This is me . That ’s Windy Corner . The rest of the pattern is the other people . Motives are all very well , but the fence comes here . ”
38240	38249	38251	38251	Lucy	115	“ We were n’t talking of real fences , ”
38255	38265	38266	38266	She	115	“ Oh , I see , dear — poetry . ”
38279	38295	38296	38296	she	115	“ I tell you who has no ‘ fences , ’ as you call them , ”
38299	38306	38296	38296	she	115	“ and that ’s Mr. Beebe . ”
38307	38317	38318	38318	Lucy	115	“ A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless . ”
38350	38358	38359	38359	she	115	“ Do n’t you like Mr. Beebe ? ”
38363	38369	38370	38370	he	210	“ I never said so ! ”
38373	38386	38388	38388	he	210	“ I consider him far above the average . I only denied — ”
38402	38412	38414	38414	she	115	“ Now , a clergyman that I do hate , ”
38421	38473	38414	38414	she	115	“ a clergyman that does have fences , and the most dreadful ones , is Mr. Eager , the English chaplain at Florence . He was truly insincere — not merely the manner unfortunate . He was a snob , and so conceited , and he did say such unkind things . ”
38474	38480	38591	38592	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ What sort of things ? ”
38481	38498	38591	38592	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife . ”
38499	38504	38414	38414	she	115	“ Perhaps he had . ”
38505	38508	38591	38592	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ No ! ”
38509	38515	38591	38592	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Why ‘ no ’ ? ”
38516	38529	38530	38530	Cecil	210	“ He was such a nice old man , I ’m sure . ”
38537	38583	38530	38530	Cecil	210	“ Well , I did try to sift the thing . Mr. Eager would never come to the point . He prefers it vague — said the old man had ‘ practically ’ murdered his wife — had murdered her in the sight of God . ”
38584	38589	38591	38592	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Hush , dear ! ”
38595	38646	38591	38592	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ But is n’t it intolerable that a person whom we ’re told to imitate should go round spreading slander ? It was , I believe , chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped . People pretended he was vulgar , but he certainly was n’t that . ”
38647	38657	38530	38530	Cecil	210	“ Poor old man ! What was his name ? ”
38658	38661	38663	38663	Lucy	115	“ Harris , ”
38666	38679	38681	38682	her mother	484	“ Let ’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person , ”
38688	38700	38701	38701	he	210	“ Is n’t Mr. Eager a parson of the cultured type ? ”
38704	38735	38701	38701	he	210	“ I do n’t know . I hate him . I ’ve heard him lecture on Giotto . I hate him . Nothing can hide a petty nature . Ihatehim . ”
38736	38744	38746	38747	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ My goodness gracious me , child ! ”
38749	38775	38746	38747	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ You ’ll blow my head off ! Whatever is there to shout over ? I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen . ”
38968	38976	38977	38977	he	210	“ I count myself a lucky person , ”
38980	39109	38977	38977	he	210	“ When I ’m in London I feel I could never live out of it . When I ’m in the country I feel the same about the country . After all , I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life , and that the people who live amongst them must be the best . It ’s true that in nine cases out of ten they do n’t seem to notice anything . The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions . Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town . Do you feel that , Mrs. Honeychurch ? ”
39194	39208	39209	39209	he	210	“ ‘ Come down , O maid , from yonder mountain height , ’ ”
39226	39230	39220	39220	She	115	“ What height ? ”
39231	39281	39220	39220	She	115	“ ‘ Come down , O maid , from yonder mountain height , What pleasure lives in height ( the shepherd sang).In height and in the splendour of the hills ? ’ Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch ’s advice and hate clergymen no more . What ’s this place ? ”
39282	39289	39291	39291	Lucy	115	“ Summer Street , of course , ”
39427	39429	39425	39425	Cecil	210	“ Cissie ”
39439	39441	39425	39425	Cecil	210	“ Albert ”
39484	39486	39490	39490	His	1275	“ Albert ”
39513	39515	39567	39568	the ladies	333	“ Cissie ”
39559	39565	39567	39568	the ladies	333	“ The place is ruined ! ”
39571	39581	39567	39568	the ladies	333	“ Summer Street will never be the same again . ”
39587	39590	39600	39600	her	115	“ Cissie ’s ”
39602	39605	39607	39608	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Stop ! ”
39617	39638	39607	39608	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Here ’s Sir Harry . Now we shall know . Sir Harry , pull those things down at once ! ”
39655	39676	39639	39641	Sir Harry Otway	145	“ Mrs. Honeychurch , I meant to . I ca n’t , I really ca n’t turn out Miss Flack . ”
39677	39711	39607	39608	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Am I not always right ? She ought to have gone before the contract was signed . Does she still live rent free , as she did in her nephew ’s time ? ”
39712	39719	39720	39720	He	145	“ But what can I do ? ”
39725	39738	39722	39722	his	145	“ An old lady , so very vulgar , and almost bedridden . ”
39739	39744	39746	39746	Cecil	210	“ Turn her out , ”
39941	39973	39928	39929	Mr. Flack	224	“ and all the capitals different — one with dragons in the foliage , another approaching to the Ionian style , another introducing Mrs. Flack ’s initials — every one different . ”
40079	40080	40145	40146	Sir Harry	145	“ Cissie”—someone
40084	40091	40092	40092	he	145	“ The rent is absurdly low , ”
40096	40132	40092	40092	he	145	“ and perhaps I am an easy landlord . But it is such an awkward size . It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves . ”
40159	40169	40170	40170	he	145	“ You ought to find a tenant at once , ”
40174	40186	40170	40170	he	145	“ It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk . ”
40187	40190	40192	40193	Sir Harry	145	“ Exactly ! ”
40196	40244	40192	40193	Sir Harry	145	“ That is exactly what I fear , Mr. Vyse . It will attract the wrong type of people . The train service has improved — a fatal improvement , to my mind . And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles ? ”
40245	40254	40256	40256	Lucy	115	“ Rather a strenuous clerk it would be , ”
40304	40308	40309	40309	she	115	“ Sir Harry ! ”
40312	40324	40309	40309	she	115	“ I have an idea . How would you like spinsters ? ”
40325	40341	40286	40286	She	115	“ My dear Lucy , it would be splendid . Do you know any such ? ”
40342	40350	40309	40309	she	115	“ Yes ; I met them abroad . ”
40351	40354	40355	40355	he	210	“ Gentlewomen ? ”
40359	40414	40355	40355	he	210	“ Yes , indeed , and at the present moment homeless . I heard from them last week — Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan . I ’m really not joking . They are quite the right people . Mr. Beebe knows them , too . May I tell them to write to you ? ”
40415	40420	40421	40421	he	210	“ Indeed you may ! ”
40424	40566	40421	40421	he	210	“ Here we are with the difficulty solved already . How delightful it is ! Extra facilities — please tell them they shall have extra facilities , for I shall have no agents ’ fees . Oh , the agents ! The appalling people they have sent me ! One woman , when I wrote — a tactful letter , you know — asking her to explain her social position to me , replied that she would pay the rent in advance . As if one cares about that ! And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory — people swindlers , or not respectable . And oh , the deceit ! I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week . The deceit of the most promising people . My dear Lucy , the deceit ! ”
40570	40574	40577	40578	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ My advice , ”
40580	40653	40577	40578	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all . I know the type . Preserve me from people who have seen better days , and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy . It ’s a sad thing , but I ’d far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down . ”
40654	40661	40663	40664	Sir Harry	145	“ I think I follow you , ”
40666	40680	40663	40664	Sir Harry	145	“ but it is , as you say , a very sad thing . ”
40681	40689	40691	40691	Lucy	115	“ The Misses Alan are n’t that ! ”
40693	40699	40701	40701	Cecil	210	“ Yes , they are , ”
40703	40723	40701	40701	Cecil	210	“ I have n’t met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood . ”
40724	40738	40577	40578	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Do n’t listen to him , Sir Harry — he ’s tiresome . ”
40739	40747	40748	40748	he	145	“ It ’s I who am tiresome , ”
40751	40795	40748	40748	he	145	“ I ought n’t to come with my troubles to young people . But really I am so worried , and Lady Otway will only say that I can not be too careful , which is quite true , but no real help . ”
40796	40806	40577	40578	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Then may I write to my Misses Alan ? ”
40807	40810	40812	40812	his	145	“ Please ! ”
40820	40865	40816	40817	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Beware ! They are certain to have canaries . Sir Harry , beware of canaries : they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come . Beware of women altogether . Only let to a man . ”
40866	40869	40870	40870	he	145	“ Really — ”
40883	40945	40880	40880	her	163	“ Men do n’t gossip over tea - cups . If they get drunk , there ’s an end of them — they lie down comfortably and sleep it off . If they ’re vulgar , they somehow keep it to themselves . It does n’t spread so . Give me a man — of course , provided he ’s clean . ”
40993	40995	40975	40975	He	145	“ Cissie ”
41043	41047	41048	41048	he	145	“ Mrs. Honeychurch , ”
41051	41062	41048	41048	he	145	“ what if we two walk home and leave you ? ”
41063	41066	41068	41068	her	163	“ Certainly ! ”
41093	41102	41085	41085	He	145	“ Aha ! young people , young people ! ”
41111	41115	41117	41117	Cecil	210	“ Hopeless vulgarian ! ”
41127	41132	41117	41117	Cecil	210	“ Oh , Cecil ! ”
41133	41150	41085	41085	He	145	“ I ca n’t help it . It would be wrong not to loathe that man . ”
41151	41163	41117	41117	Cecil	210	“ He is n’t clever , but really he is nice . ”
41164	41238	41117	41117	Cecil	210	“ No , Lucy , he stands for all that is bad in country life . In London he would keep his place . He would belong to a brainless club , and his wife would give brainless dinner parties . But down here he acts the little god with his gentility , and his patronage , and his sham aesthetics , and every one — even your mother — is taken in . ”
41239	41248	41250	41250	Lucy	115	“ All that you say is quite true , ”
41257	41269	41250	41250	Lucy	115	“ I wonder whether — whether it matters so very much . ”
41270	41336	41250	41250	Lucy	115	“ It matters supremely . Sir Harry is the essence of that garden - party . Oh , goodness , how cross I feel ! How I do hope he ’ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa — some woman so really vulgar that he ’ll notice it . Gentlefolks!Ugh ! with his bald head and retreating chin ! But let ’s forget him . ”
41396	41405	41389	41389	Cecil	210	“ It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy ”
41467	41474	41475	41475	she	115	“ Which way shall we go ? ”
41512	41518	41501	41501	she	115	“ Are there two ways ? ”
41519	41534	41501	41501	she	115	“ Perhaps the road is more sensible , as we ’re got up smart . ”
41535	41544	41546	41546	Cecil	210	“ I ’d rather go through the wood , ”
41562	41598	41546	41546	Cecil	210	“ Why is it , Lucy , that you always say the road ? Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged ? ”
41599	41609	41611	41611	Lucy	115	“ Have n’t I ? The wood , then , ”
41665	41689	41654	41654	he	210	“ I had got an idea — I dare say wrongly — that you feel more at home with me in a room . ”
41690	41694	41695	41695	she	115	“ A room ? ”
41701	41727	41695	41695	she	115	“ Yes . Or , at the most , in a garden , or on a road . Never in the real country like this . ”
41728	41761	41654	41654	he	210	“ Oh , Cecil , whatever do you mean ? I have never felt anything of the sort . You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person . ”
41762	41795	41796	41796	She	115	“ I do n’t know that you are n’t . I connect you with a view — a certain type of view . Why should n’t you connect me with a room ? ”
41807	41843	41796	41796	She	115	“ Do you know that you ’re right ? I do . I must be a poetess after all . When I think of you it ’s always as in a room . How funny ! ”
41852	41864	41848	41848	he	1313	“ A drawing - room , pray ? With no view ? ”
41865	41878	41921	41921	she	115	“ Yes , with no view , I fancy . Why not ? ”
41879	41884	41885	41885	he	1313	“ I ’d rather , ”
41889	41899	41885	41885	he	1313	“ that you connected me with the open air . ”
41904	41914	41900	41900	She	115	“ Oh , Cecil , whatever do you mean ? ”
42041	42046	42038	42038	She	115	“ The Sacred Lake ! ”
42047	42055	42038	42038	She	115	“ Why do you call it that ? ”
42056	42132	42038	42038	She	115	“ I ca n’t remember why . I suppose it comes out of some book . It ’s only a puddle now , but you see that stream going through it ? Well , a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains , and ca n’t get away at once , and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful . Then Freddy used to bathe there . He is very fond of it . ”
42133	42137	42138	42138	He	129	“ And you ? ”
42141	42148	42138	42138	He	129	“ Are you fond of it ? ”
42154	42173	42150	42150	she	115	“ I bathed here , too , till I was found out . Then there was a row . ”
42262	42268	42273	42273	she	115	“ Who found you out ? ”
42269	42272	42273	42273	she	115	“ Charlotte , ”
42276	42287	42273	42273	she	115	“ She was stopping with us . Charlotte — Charlotte . ”
42288	42292	42293	42293	She	115	“ Poor girl ! ”
42312	42315	42293	42293	She	115	“ Lucy ! ”
42316	42327	42329	42329	her	115	“ Yes , I suppose we ought to be going , ”
42332	42349	42329	42329	her	115	“ Lucy , I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before . ”
42365	42370	42357	42357	she	115	“ What , Cecil ? ”
42371	42389	42390	42390	He	129	“ Hitherto never — not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me — ”
42411	42414	42406	42406	His	129	“ Yes ? ”
42415	42425	42426	42426	She	115	“ Up to now I have never kissed you . ”
42440	42447	42448	42448	she	115	“ No — more you have , ”
42451	42461	42448	42448	she	115	“ Then I ask you — may I now ? ”
42462	42485	42498	42498	Her	115	“ Of course , you may , Cecil . You might before . I ca n’t run at you , you know . ”
42715	42724	42707	42707	she	115	“ Emerson was the name , not Harris . ”
42725	42729	42707	42707	she	115	“ What name ? ”
42730	42736	42707	42707	she	115	“ The old man ’s . ”
42737	42742	42707	42707	she	115	“ What old man ? ”
42743	42761	42762	42762	He	129	“ That old man I told you about . The one Mr. Eager was so unkind to . ”
42953	42963	42964	42964	she	2477	“ I can not think what people are doing , ”
42968	42978	42964	42964	she	2477	“ but it is extremely fortunate for the children . ”
43313	43320	43321	43321	he	210	“ Does that very much matter ? ”
43549	43577	43536	43536	she	115	“ Oh , it has been such a nuisance — first he , then they — no one knowing what they wanted , and everyone so tiresome . ”
43578	43586	43588	43589	Mr. Beebe	120	“ But they really are coming now , ”
43591	43635	43588	43589	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago — she was wondering how often the butcher called , and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably . They are coming . I heard from them this morning . “
43643	43648	43640	43641	Miss Alans	160	” Mrs. Honeychurch cried . “
43691	43722	43680	43680	Lucy	115	” Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tennis - court . Cecil was absent — one did not play bumble - puppy when he was there . “
43737	43761	43735	43735	Saturn	242	” Saturn was a tennis - ball whose skin was partially unsewn . When in motion his orb was encircled by a ring . “
43817	43818	43815	43815	Saturn	242	” “
43828	43835	43836	43836	Minnie	241	” cried Freddy , joining them . “
43845	43846	43847	43847	Saturn	242	” “
43852	43853	43854	43854	Saturn	242	” “
43858	43859	43862	43862	he	242	” “
43866	43867	43862	43862	he	242	” “
43879	43880	43874	43877	the Beautiful White Devil	243	” “
43885	43890	43874	43877	the Beautiful White Devil	243	” said Mrs. Honeychurch . “
43945	43967	43924	43924	Minnie	241	” Lucy fell , the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand . Mr. Beebe picked it up , and said : “
43979	44092	44093	44093	I	0	” But his correction passed unheeded . Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury , and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a well - mannered child into a howling wilderness . Up in the house Cecil heard them , and , though he was full of entertaining news , he did not come down to impart it , in case he got hurt . He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man . But he hated the physical violence of the young . How right it was ! Sure enough it ended in a cry . “
44102	44129	44095	44097	the Miss Alans	160	” observed Mr. Beebe , just as Lucy , who was nursing the injured Minnie , was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother . “
44136	44140	44141	44141	They	1373	” Freddy panted . “
44147	44148	44141	44141	They	1373	” “
44155	44176	44141	44141	They	1373	” Here his foot slipped , and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass . An interval elapses . “
44182	44195	44196	44196	Alan	235	” asked Lucy , with her brother ’s head in her lap . “
44210	44211	44205	44205	Harry	145	” “
44222	44223	44225	44225	yourself	129	” “
44242	44246	44234	44234	He	145	Honeychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem

44314	44319	44296	44296	Anderson	246	” Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed . “

44438	44498	44499	44499	Emerson	119	” Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky . Mr. Beebe , whose opinion of her rose daily , whispered to his niece thatthatwas the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong . Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities . “
44511	44512	44504	44504	you	129	” “
44523	44566	44567	44567	I	0	” retorted Freddy , who was democratic . Like his sister and like most young people , he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality , and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure . “
44580	44584	44567	44567	I	0	Lucy”—she was sitting up again—“I
44620	44621	44622	44622	Emerson	119	” “
44629	44675	44622	44622	Emerson	119	” Lucy remarked . She was gazing sideways . Seated on a promontory herself , she could see the pine - clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald . The further one descended the garden , the more glorious was this lateral view . “
44709	44710	44707	44707	you	129	” “
44715	44719	44707	44707	you	129	” he grumbled . “

44755	44759	44753	44753	Cecil	210	” exclaimed Lucy . “
44767	44773	44774	44774	Lucy	115	” said his mother placidly . “
44791	44792	44795	44795	Cecil	210	” “
44797	44798	44795	44795	Cecil	210	” “
44804	44808	44795	44795	Cecil	210	” he repeated , “
44831	44881	44823	44823	I	0	” She got up from the grass . It was hard on Lucy . Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much . While she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway , she had borne it like a good girl . She might well “
44883	44937	44823	44823	I	0	” when she heard that it came partly from her lover . Mr. Vyse was a tease — something worse than a tease : he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people . The clergyman , knowing this , looked at Miss Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness . When she exclaimed , “
44956	44989	44990	44995	The Emersons who were at Florence	1392	” he did not consider that the exclamation was strange , but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure . He diverted it as follows : “
45053	45059	45051	45051	we	1397	” He appealed to Lucy . “
45172	45173	45174	45174	Fiasco	250	” “
45181	45214	45177	45177	you	0	” remarked Freddy , not seeing that his sister ’s face was very red . She could not recover herself . Mr. Beebe saw it , and continued to divert the conversation . “
45275	45311	45269	45269	he	387	” In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip , but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble . He repeated any rubbish that came into his head . “
45316	45321	45269	45269	he	387	” said Mrs. Honeychurch . “
45383	45472	45378	45378	Charlotte	185	” Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer . He suggested that his hostess was mistaken . At the hint of opposition she warmed . She was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told . The name escaped her . What was the name ? Oh , what was the name ? She clasped her knees for the name . Something in Thackeray . She struck her matronly forehead . Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in . “
45479	45492	45493	45493	I	0	” he cried , and tried to catch her by the ankles . “
45497	45502	45493	45493	I	0	” she said gravely . “
45516	45526	45527	45527	Harris	145	” As she left them her mother ’s shout of “
45529	45643	45644	45644	Cecil	210	” shivered the tranquil air , and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right . Such a senseless lie , too , yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons , friends of Cecil ’s , with a pair of nondescript tourists . Hitherto truth had come to her naturally . She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant , and be — absolutely truthful ? Well , at all events , she must not tell lies . She hurried up the garden , still flushed with shame . A word from Cecil would soothe her , she was sure . “
45646	45647	45648	45648	Hullo	251	” “
45650	45670	45648	45648	Hullo	251	” he called , and leant out of the smoking - room window . He seemed in high spirits . “
45763	45783	45758	45758	you	1417	” He looked very attractive when his face was bright , and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once . “
45788	45792	45793	45793	Freddy	129	” she said . “
45847	45848	45839	45839	you	1417	” “
45853	45857	45839	45839	you	1417	” he laughed . “
45872	45881	45839	45839	you	1417	” But she remained standing where she was . “
45908	45909	45903	45904	my mother	2662	” “
45918	45923	45924	45924	I	0	” she said nervously . “

45978	45982	45976	45976	Cecil	210	” proceeded hilariously . “
46057	46058	46059	46059	Cecil	210	” “
46075	46081	46068	46068	I	0	” He bore her down . “
46162	46163	46157	46157	I	0	” “
46170	46174	46166	46166	you	210	” she snapped . “
46184	46201	46175	46175	You	210	” He stared at her , and felt again that she had failed to be Leonardesque . “
46208	46220	46204	46204	you	210	” Her face was inartistic — that of a peevish virago . “
46286	46291	46278	46278	I	0	” She left him . “
46294	46378	46278	46278	I	0	” he thought , raising his eyebrows . No , it was worse than temper — snobbishness . As long as Lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans , she had not minded . He perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally . He would tolerate the father and draw out the son , who was silent . In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth , he would bring them to Windy Corner .
46674	46680	46681	46681	she	115	“ Cecil — Cecil darling , ”

47188	47396	47171	47171	Lucy	115	“ Many thanks for your warning . When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the mountain , you made me promise not to tell mother , because you said she would blame you for not being always with me . I have kept that promise , and can not possibly tell her now . I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence , and that they are respectable people — which Idothink — and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself . She should have tried at the Rectory . I can not begin making a fuss at this stage . You must see that it would be too absurd . If the Emersons heard I had complained of them , they would think themselves of importance , which is exactly what they are not . I like the old father , and look forward to seeing him again . As for the son , I am sorry forhimwhen we meet , rather than for myself . They are known to Cecil , who is very well and spoke of you the other day . We expect to be married in January . “
47439	47441	47433	47434	No one	2165	“ Yours affectionately,“L.
47445	47545	47546	47546	Emerson	119	” Secrecy has this disadvantage : we lose the sense of proportion ; we can not tell whether our secret is important or not . Were Lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil ’s life if he discovered it , or with a little thing which he would laugh at ? Miss Bartlett suggested the former . Perhaps she was right . It had become a great thing now . Left to herself , Lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously , and it would have remained a little thing . “
47550	47776	47779	47779	Beethoven	161	” ; it was only that a few weeks ago . She tried to tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school . But her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped . She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on . It did her no harm , Cecil thought , to learn the framework of society , while society itself was absent on the golf - links or the moors . The weather was cool , and it did her no harm . In spite of the season , Mrs. Vyse managed to scrape together a dinner - party consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people . The food was poor , but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl . One was tired of everything , it seemed . One launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully , and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter . In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini and Windy Corner appeared equally crude , and Lucy saw that her London career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past . The grandchildren asked her to play the piano . She played Schumann . “
47780	47877	47779	47779	Beethoven	161	” called Cecil , when the querulous beauty of the music had died . She shook her head and played Schumann again . The melody rose , unprofitably magical . It broke ; it was resumed broken , not marching once from the cradle to the grave . The sadness of the incomplete — the sadness that is often Life , but should never be Art — throbbed in its disjected phrases , and made the nerves of the audience throb . Not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the Bertolini , and “
47881	48022	48074	48074	she	115	” was not the remark that Mr. Beebe had passed to himself when she returned . When the guests were gone , and Lucy had gone to bed , Mrs. Vyse paced up and down the drawing - room , discussing her little party with her son . Mrs. Vyse was a nice woman , but her personality , like many another ’s , had been swamped by London , for it needs a strong head to live among many people . The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her ; and she had seen too many seasons , too many cities , too many men , for her abilities , and even with Cecil she was mechanical , and behaved as if he was not one son , but , so to speak , a filial crowd . “
48029	48053	48074	48074	she	115	” she said , looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence , and straining her lips apart until she spoke again . “
48061	48062	48054	48054	Lucy	115	” “
48069	48070	48063	48063	Her	115	” “
48109	48110	48093	48093	She	115	” “
48116	48117	48093	48093	She	115	” “
48120	48134	48093	48093	She	115	” she murmured , thinking of the museum that represented Italy to her . “
48156	48157	48149	48149	She	115	” “
48162	48166	48159	48159	her	115	” he exclaimed . “
48254	48270	48245	48245	I	0	” He broke off , remembering that he had had one himself , and concluded , “
48279	48280	48245	48245	I	0	” “
48287	48349	48245	48245	I	0	” repeated Mrs. Vyse , and processed to bed . As she was dozing off , a cry — the cry of nightmare — rang from Lucy ’s room . Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought it kind to go herself . She found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek . “
48363	48364	48355	48356	Mrs. Vyse	186	” “
48368	48369	48355	48356	Mrs. Vyse	186	” “
48373	48386	48355	48356	Mrs. Vyse	186	” The elder lady smiled and kissed her , saying very distinctly : “
48409	48444	48398	48398	He	1483	” Lucy returned the kiss , still covering one cheek with her hand . Mrs. Vyse recessed to bed . Cecil , whom the cry had not awoke , snored . Darkness enveloped the flat .
48543	48557	48533	48533	Freddy	129	“ Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little . ”
48558	48561	48533	48533	Freddy	129	“ M’m . ”
48562	48568	48569	48569	Freddy	129	“ They might amuse you . ”
48603	48611	48613	48614	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I suggested we should hinder them , ”
48616	48622	48627	48627	he	120	“ They are worth it . ”
48637	48640	48641	48641	he	120	“ Hullo ! ”
48663	48666	48641	48641	he	120	“ Hullo ! ”
48667	48676	48627	48627	he	120	“ I ’ve brought someone to see you . ”
48677	48686	48641	48641	he	120	“ I ’ll be down in a minute . ”
48725	48732	48733	48733	Freddy	129	“ Are these people great readers ? ”
48736	48742	48733	48733	Freddy	129	“ Are they that sort ? ”
48743	48821	48641	48641	he	120	“ I fancy they know how to read — a rare accomplishment . What have they got ? Byron . Exactly . A Shropshire Lad . Never heard of it . The Way of All Flesh . Never heard of it . Gibbon . Hullo ! dear George reads German . Um — um — Schopenhauer , Nietzsche , and so we go on . Well , I suppose your generation knows its own business , Honeychurch . ”
48822	48830	48832	48832	Freddy	129	“ Mr. Beebe , look at that , ”
48854	48863	48847	48848	an amateur	1494	“ Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes . ”
48864	48888	48927	48928	the clergyman	368	“ I know . Is n’t it jolly ? I like that . I ’m certain that ’s the old man ’s doing . ”
48889	48896	48927	48928	the clergyman	368	“ How very odd of him ! ”
48897	48902	48927	48928	the clergyman	368	“ Surely you agree ? ”
48923	48926	48927	48928	the clergyman	368	“ Pictures ! ”
48936	48950	48927	48928	the clergyman	368	“ Giotto — they got that at Florence , I ’ll be bound . ”
48951	48959	48927	48928	the clergyman	368	“ The same as Lucy ’s got . ”
48960	48975	48927	48928	the clergyman	368	“ Oh , by - the - by , did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London ? ”
48976	48982	48927	48928	the clergyman	368	“ She came back yesterday . ”
48983	48992	48927	48928	the clergyman	368	“ I suppose she had a good time ? ”
48993	48998	49000	49000	Freddy	129	“ Yes , very , ”
49007	49016	49000	49000	Freddy	129	“ She and Cecil are thicker than ever . ”
49017	49023	48927	48928	the clergyman	368	“ That ’s good hearing . ”
49024	49037	49000	49000	Freddy	129	“ I wish I was n’t such a fool , Mr. Beebe . ”
49044	49075	49038	49039	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am , but it ’ll be very different now , mother thinks . She will read all kinds of books . ”
49076	49081	48927	48928	the clergyman	368	“ So will you . ”
49082	49127	49000	49000	Freddy	129	“ Only medical books . Not books that you can talk about afterwards . Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian , and he says her playing is wonderful . There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed . Cecil says — ”
49128	49148	49149	49149	George	119	“ What on earth are those people doing upstairs ? Emerson — we think we ’ll come another time . ”
49163	49173	49149	49149	George	119	“ Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch , a neighbour . ”
49213	49224	49208	49208	he	129	“ How d’ye do ? Come and have a bathe . ”
49225	49231	49233	49233	George	119	“ Oh , all right , ”
49243	49260	49261	49261	he	120	“ ‘ How d’ye do ? how d’ye do ? Come and have a bathe , ’ ”
49264	49331	49261	49261	he	120	“ That ’s the best conversational opening I ’ve ever heard . But I ’m afraid it will only act between men . Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘ How do you do ? Come and have a bathe ’ ? And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal . ”
49332	49341	49343	49344	Mr. Emerson	119	“ I tell you that they shall be , ”
49354	49375	49343	49344	Mr. Emerson	119	“ Good afternoon , Mr. Beebe . I tell you they shall be comrades , and George thinks the same . ”
49376	49386	49387	49388	the clergyman	368	“ We are to raise ladies to our level ? ”
49391	49397	49387	49388	the clergyman	368	“ The Garden of Eden , ”
49405	49431	49399	49400	Mr. Emerson	119	“ which you place in the past , is really yet to come . We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies . ”
49442	49477	49432	49433	Mr. Beebe	120	“ In this — not in other things — we men are ahead . We despise the body less than women do . But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden . ”
49478	49487	49489	49489	Freddy	129	“ I say , what about this bathe ? ”
49502	49552	49489	49489	Freddy	129	“ I believed in a return to Nature once . But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her ? To - day , I believe that we must discover Nature . After many conquests we shall attain simplicity . It is our heritage . ”
49553	49568	49432	49433	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch , whose sister you will remember at Florence . ”
49569	49704	49432	49433	Mr. Beebe	120	“ How do you do ? Very glad to see you , and that you are taking George for a bathe . Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry . Marriage is a duty . I am sure that she will be happy , for we know Mr. Vyse , too . He has been most kind . He met us by chance in the National Gallery , and arranged everything about this delightful house . Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway . I have met so few Liberal landowners , and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude . Ah , this wind ! You do well to bathe . Yours is a glorious country , Honeychurch ! ”
49705	49710	49712	49712	Freddy	129	“ Not a bit ! ”
49714	49744	49712	49712	Freddy	129	“ I must — that is to say , I have to — have the pleasure of calling on you later on , my mother says , I hope . ”
49745	49779	49780	49781	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Call , my lad ? Who taught us that drawing - room twaddle ? Call on your grandmother ! Listen to the wind among the pines ! Yours is a glorious country . ”
49787	49854	49780	49781	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Mr. Emerson , he will call , I shall call ; you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed . I trust that you have realized about the ten days ’ interval . It does not count that I helped you with the stair - eyes yesterday . It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon . ”
49855	49910	49911	49911	George	119	“ Yes , go and bathe , George . Why do you dawdle talking ? Bring them back to tea . Bring back some milk , cakes , honey . The change will do you good . George has been working very hard at his office . I ca n’t believe he ’s well . ”
49931	49939	49940	49940	Freddy	129	“ Do you really want this bathe ? ”
49944	49966	49940	49940	Freddy	129	“ It is only a pond , do n’t you know . I dare say you are used to something better . ”
49967	49978	49979	49980	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Yes — I have said ‘ Yes ’ already . ”
50115	50141	50087	50087	George	119	“ And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse ! Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here ? ”
50142	50152	50082	50082	He	120	“ I did not . Miss Lavish told me . ”
50153	50173	50087	50087	George	119	“ When I was a young man , I always meant to write a ‘ History of Coincidence . ’ ”
50177	50214	50087	50087	George	119	“ Though , as a matter of fact , coincidences are much rarer than we suppose . For example , it is n’t purely coincidentally that you are here now , when one comes to reflect . ”
50224	50268	50219	50219	George	119	“ It is . I have reflected . It is Fate . Everything is Fate . We are flung together by Fate , drawn apart by Fate — flung together , drawn apart . The twelve winds blow us — we settle nothing — ”
50269	50277	50279	50280	the clergyman	368	“ You have not reflected at all , ”
50282	50337	50279	50280	the clergyman	368	“ Let me give you a useful tip , Emerson : attribute nothing to Fate . Do n’t say , ‘ I did n’t do this , ’ for you did it , ten to one . Now I ’ll cross - question you . Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself ? ”
50338	50341	50219	50219	George	119	“ Italy . ”
50342	50359	50219	50219	George	119	“ And where did you meet Mr. Vyse , who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch ? ”
50360	50364	50279	50280	the clergyman	368	“ National Gallery . ”
50365	50410	50219	50219	George	119	“ Looking at Italian art . There you are , and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate . You naturally seek out things Italian , and so do we and our friends . This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it . ”
50411	50420	50422	50422	George	119	“ It is Fate that I am here , ”
50424	50438	50422	50422	George	119	“ But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy . ”
50468	50488	50489	50489	Silence	272	“ And so for this and for other reasons my ‘ History of Coincidence ’ is still to write . ”
50501	50512	50498	50498	he	120	“ We are all so glad that you have come . ”
50515	50520	50522	50522	Freddy	129	“ Here we are ! ”
50524	50529	50531	50532	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Oh , good ! ”
50538	50551	50552	50552	he	120	“ In there ’s the pond . I wish it was bigger , ”
50631	50641	50643	50644	Mr. Beebe	120	“ It ’s distinctly successful , as ponds go , ”
50646	50655	50643	50644	Mr. Beebe	120	“ No apologies are necessary for the pond . ”
50671	50699	50656	50656	George	119	“ Are n’t those masses of willow - herb splendid ? I love willow - herb in seed . What ’s the name of this aromatic plant ? ”
50709	50752	50656	50656	George	119	“ These abrupt changes of vegetation — this little spongeous tract of water plants , and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle — heather , bracken , hurts , pines . Very charming , very charming . ”
50753	50762	50764	50764	Freddy	129	“ Mr. Beebe , are n’t you bathing ? ”
50778	50783	50785	50785	Freddy	129	“ Water ’s wonderful ! ”
50790	50795	50797	50797	George	119	“ Water ’s water , ”
50868	50875	50877	50877	Freddy	129	“ Apooshoo , apooshoo , apooshoo , ”
50896	50902	50907	50907	Michelangelesque	273	“ Is it worth it ? ”
50932	50954	50925	50925	he	129	“ Hee - poof — I’ve swallowed a pollywog , Mr. Beebe , water ’s wonderful , water ’s simply ripping . ”
50955	50962	50964	50964	George	119	“ Water ’s not so bad , ”
50977	50987	50964	50964	George	119	“ Water ’s wonderful . Mr. Beebe , do . ”
50988	50993	50994	50995	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Apooshoo , kouf . ”
51084	51091	51095	51095	his	120	“ I may as well wash too ”
51289	51297	51299	51299	Freddy	129	“ Race you round it , then , ”
51386	51411	51421	51421	Freddy	129	“ No . We are what matters . Without us shall no enterprise begin . To us shall all flesh turn in the end . ”
51412	51419	51421	51421	Freddy	129	“ A try ! A try ! ”
51438	51442	51443	51443	George	119	“ Socker rules , ”
51454	51457	51443	51443	George	119	“ Goal ! ”
51458	51461	51474	51475	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Goal ! ”
51462	51465	51443	51443	George	119	“ Pass ! ”
51466	51472	51474	51475	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Take care my watch ! ”
51483	51505	51474	51475	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Take care my hat ! No , that ’s enough , Freddy . Dress now . No , I say ! ”
51542	51547	51549	51550	Mr. Beebe	120	“ That ’ll do ! ”
51578	51591	51564	51564	his	120	“ Hi ! Steady on ! I see people coming you fellows ! ”
51602	51607	51564	51564	his	120	“ Hi ! hi!Ladies ! ”
51690	51694	51696	51697	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Gracious alive ! ”
51699	51724	51696	51697	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Whoever were those unfortunate people ? Oh , dears , look away ! And poor Mr. Beebe , too ! Whatever has happened ? ”
51725	51731	51733	51733	Cecil	210	“ Come this way immediately , ”
51773	51797	51761	51761	He	210	“ Oh , poor Mr. Beebe ! Was that his waistcoat we left in the path ? Cecil , Mr. Beebe ’s waistcoat — ”
51816	51819	51808	51808	Lucy	115	“ minded . ”
51820	51831	51804	51804	Cecil	210	“ I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond . ”
51832	51844	51845	51845	They	1537	“ This way , please , Mrs. Honeychurch , this way . ”
51866	51873	51881	51881	Freddy	129	“ Well , Ican’t help it , ”
51897	51908	51881	51881	Freddy	129	“ I ca n’t be trodden on , can I ? ”
51909	51941	51804	51804	Cecil	210	“ Good gracious me , dear ; so it ’s you ! What miserable management ! Why not have a comfortable bath at home , with hot and cold laid on ? ”
51942	51966	51881	51881	Freddy	129	“ Look here , mother , a fellow must wash , and a fellow ’s got to dry , and if another fellow — ”
51967	51991	51992	51992	They	1537	“ Dear , no doubt you ’re right as usual , but you are in no position to argue . Come , Lucy . ”
51995	52013	51992	51992	They	1537	“ Oh , look — don’t look ! Oh , poor Mr. Beebe ! How unfortunate again — ”
52055	52064	52066	52066	he	119	“ And me , I ’ve swallowed one , ”
52071	52099	52066	52066	he	119	“ I ’ve swallowed a pollywog . It wriggleth in my tummy . I shall die — Emerson you beast , you ’ve got on my bags . ”
52100	52105	52107	52108	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Hush , dears , ”
52118	52138	52107	52108	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first . All these colds come of not drying thoroughly . ”
52139	52146	52148	52148	Lucy	115	“ Mother , do come away , ”
52150	52160	52148	52148	Lucy	115	“ Oh for goodness ’ sake , do come . ”
52161	52164	52166	52166	George	119	“ Hullo ! ”
52198	52206	52195	52195	he	119	“ Hullo , Miss Honeychurch ! Hullo ! ”
52207	52223	52195	52195	he	119	“ Bow , Lucy ; better bow . Whoever is it ? I shall bow . ”
52476	52481	52482	52482	she	115	“ I will bow , ”
52486	52503	52482	52482	she	115	“ I will not shake hands with him . That will be just the proper thing . ”
52618	52620	52606	52606	he	210	“ Yes ”
52622	52624	52606	52606	he	210	“ No ”
52708	52711	52713	52714	her mother	484	“ Lucy , ”
52721	52729	52713	52714	her mother	484	“ is anything the matter with Cecil ? ”
52747	52763	52738	52739	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ No , I do n’t think so , mother ; Cecil ’s all right . ”
52764	52770	52771	52771	Lucy	115	“ Perhaps he ’s tired . ”
52781	52783	52738	52739	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Because otherwise”—she
52792	52801	52738	52739	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	displeasure—“because otherwise I can not account for him . ”
52802	52817	52738	52739	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome , if you mean that . ”
52818	52860	52738	52739	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Cecil has told you to think so . You were devoted to her as a little girl , and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever . No — it is just the same thing everywhere . ”
52861	52873	52738	52739	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Let me just put your bonnet away , may I ? ”
52874	52887	52738	52739	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Surely he could answer her civilly for one half - hour ? ”
52888	52898	52900	52900	Lucy	115	“ Cecil has a very high standard for people , ”
52906	52924	52900	52900	Lucy	115	“ It ’s part of his ideals — it is really that that makes him sometimes seem — ”
52925	52949	52951	52952	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Oh , rubbish ! If high ideals make a young man rude , the sooner he gets rid of them the better , ”
52959	52974	52951	52952	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Now , mother ! I ’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself ! ”
52975	53006	52738	52739	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Not in that way . At times I could wring her neck . But not in that way . No . It is the same with Cecil all over . ”
53007	53032	52738	52739	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ By - the - by — I never told you . I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London . ”
53049	53121	53044	53045	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Since Cecil came back from London , nothing appears to please him . Whenever I speak he winces;—I see him , Lucy ; it is useless to contradict me . No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical , but I can not help the drawing - room furniture ; your father bought it and we must put up with it , will Cecil kindly remember . ”
53122	53171	52738	52739	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ I — I see what you mean , and certainly Cecil ought n’t to . But he does not mean to be uncivil — he once explained — it is thethingsthat upset him — he is easily upset by ugly things — he is not uncivil topeople . ”
53172	53184	53044	53045	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings ? ”
53185	53202	53044	53045	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ You ca n’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do . ”
53203	53224	52738	52739	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Then why did n’t he leave the room ? Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone ’s pleasure ? ”
53225	53234	53236	53236	Lucy	115	“ We must n’t be unjust to people , ”
53407	53419	53388	53388	Lucy	115	“ Go and dress , dear ; you ’ll be late . ”
53420	53426	53357	53357	she	115	“ All right , mother — ”
53427	53440	53441	53441	She	115	“ Do n’t say ‘ All right ’ and stop . Go . ”
53506	53521	53501	53501	she	115	“ Oh , dear , what shall I do , what shall I do ? ”
53591	53600	53576	53576	Freddy	129	“ I say , those are topping people . ”
53601	53658	53576	53576	Freddy	129	“ My dear baby , how tiresome you ’ve been ! You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred Lake ; it ’s much too public . It was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else . Do be more careful . You forget the place is growing half suburban . ”
53659	53671	53576	53576	Freddy	129	“ I say , is anything on to - morrow week ? ”
53672	53679	53576	53576	Freddy	129	“ Not that I know of . ”
53680	53693	53576	53576	Freddy	129	“ Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis . ”
53694	53715	53576	53576	Freddy	129	“ Oh , I would n’t do that , Freddy , I would n’t do that with all this muddle . ”
53716	53740	53576	53576	Freddy	129	“ What ’s wrong with the court ? They wo n’t mind a bump or two , and I ’ve ordered new balls . ”
53741	53751	53752	53752	He	1578	“ I meantit’sbetter not . I really mean it . ”
53814	53843	53806	53807	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Lucy , what a noise you ’re making ! I have something to say to you . Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte ? ”
53849	53863	53806	53807	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Yes . I really ca n’t stop . I must dress too . ”
53864	53869	53806	53807	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ How ’s Charlotte ? ”
53870	53874	53806	53807	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ All right . ”
53875	53878	53879	53881	The unfortunate girl	1583	“ Lucy ! ”
53884	53907	53879	53881	The unfortunate girl	1583	“ You ’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one ’s sentences . Did Charlotte mention her boiler ? ”
53908	53911	53806	53807	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Herwhat ? ”
53912	53944	53879	53881	The unfortunate girl	1583	“ Do n’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October , and her bath cistern cleaned out , and all kinds of terrible to - doings ? ”
53945	53955	53957	53957	Lucy	115	“ I ca n’t remember all Charlotte ’s worries , ”
53960	53978	53957	53957	Lucy	115	“ I shall have enough of my own , now that you are not pleased with Cecil . ”
53993	54011	53990	53990	She	163	“ Come here , old lady — thank you for putting away my bonnet — kiss me . ”
54142	54150	54139	54139	Freddy	129	“ Lucy , what ’s Emerson like ? ”
54151	54158	54160	54160	Lucy	115	“ I saw him in Florence , ”
54171	54185	54160	54160	Lucy	115	“ Is he the clever sort , or is he a decent chap ? ”
54186	54198	54139	54139	Freddy	129	“ Ask Cecil ; it is Cecil who brought him here . ”
54199	54209	54211	54211	Cecil	210	“ He is the clever sort , like myself , ”
54219	54230	54232	54233	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ How well did you know them at the Bertolini ? ”
54235	54253	54232	54233	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Oh , very slightly . I mean , Charlotte knew them even less than I did . ”
54254	54272	54139	54139	Freddy	129	“ Oh , that reminds me — you never told me what Charlotte said in her letter . ”
54273	54279	54281	54281	Lucy	115	“ One thing and another , ”
54295	54328	54281	54281	Lucy	115	“ Among other things , that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street , wondered if she ’d come up and see us , and mercifully did n’t . ”
54329	54341	54375	54375	She	163	“ Lucy , I do call the way you talk unkind . ”
54342	54348	54350	54350	Lucy	115	“ She was a novelist , ”
54405	54418	54421	54421	she	163	“ If books must be written , let them be written by men ”
54435	54446	54421	54421	she	163	“ This year , next year , now , never , ”
54578	54597	54567	54568	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I have been thinking , Lucy , of that letter of Charlotte ’s . How is she ? ”
54598	54605	54567	54568	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I tore the thing up . ”
54606	54622	54567	54568	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Did n’t she say how she was ? How does she sound ? Cheerful ? ”
54623	54640	54567	54568	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Oh , yes I suppose so — no — not very cheerful , I suppose . ”
54641	54675	54676	54676	Cecil	210	“ Then , depend upon it , itisthe boiler . I know myself how water preys upon one ’s mind . I would rather anything else — even a misfortune with the meat . ”
54684	54689	54691	54691	Freddy	129	“ So would I , ”
54710	54717	54718	54718	she	1119	“ And I have been thinking , ”
54723	54758	54718	54718	she	1119	“ surely we could squeeze Charlotte in here next week , and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish . I have not seen poor Charlotte for so long . ”
54783	54788	54789	54789	she	1119	“ Mother , no ! ”
54792	54853	54789	54789	she	1119	“ It ’s impossible . We ca n’t have Charlotte on the top of the other things ; we ’re squeezed to death as it is . Freddy ’s got a friend coming Tuesday , there ’s Cecil , and you ’ve promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare . It simply ca n’t be done . ”
54854	54860	54789	54789	she	1119	“ Nonsense ! It can . ”
54861	54872	54789	54789	she	1119	“ If Minnie sleeps in the bath . Not otherwise . ”
54873	54880	54789	54789	she	1119	“ Minnie can sleep with you . ”
54881	54888	54789	54789	she	1119	“ I wo n’t have her . ”
54889	54907	54789	54789	she	1119	“ Then , if you ’re so selfish , Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy . ”
54908	54918	54920	54920	Cecil	210	“ Miss Bartlett , Miss Bartlett , Miss Bartlett , ”
54930	54935	54937	54937	Lucy	115	“ It ’s impossible , ”
54939	54964	54937	54937	Lucy	115	“ I do n’t want to make difficulties , but it really is n’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so . ”
54967	54980	54937	54937	Lucy	115	“ The truth is , dear , you do n’t like Charlotte . ”
54981	55044	55054	55055	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ No , I do n’t . And no more does Cecil . She gets on our nerves . You have n’t seen her lately , and do n’t realize how tiresome she can be , though so good . So please , mother , do n’t worry us this last summer ; but spoil us by not asking her to come . ”
55045	55050	55052	55052	Cecil	210	“ Hear , hear ! ”
55075	55147	55148	55148	Cecil	210	“ This is n’t very kind of you two . You have each other and all these woods to walk in , so full of beautiful things ; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers . You are young , dears , and however clever young people are , and however many books they read , they will never guess what it feels like to grow old . ”
55153	55172	55175	55175	Freddy	129	“ I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike , ”
55177	55207	55175	55175	Freddy	129	“ She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool , and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right . ”
55208	55236	55238	55238	Lucy	115	“ I know , dear . She is kind to everyone , and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return . ”
55293	55316	55287	55287	She	115	“ I ca n’t help it , mother . I do n’t like Charlotte . I admit it ’s horrid of me . ”
55317	55329	55287	55287	She	115	“ From your own account , you told her as much . ”
55330	55343	55349	55349	they	1603	“ Well , she would leave Florence so stupidly . She flurried — ”
55414	55429	55431	55431	Cecil	210	“ I suppose Miss Bartlett must come , since she boils eggs so well , ”
55449	55458	55460	55460	Freddy	129	“ I did n’t mean the egg waswellboiled , ”
55462	55497	55460	55460	Freddy	129	“ because in point of fact she forgot to take it off , and as a matter of fact I do n’t care for eggs . I only meant how jolly kind she seemed . ”
55522	55533	55534	55534	he	129	“ May me and Lucy get down from our chairs ? ”
55542	55550	55534	55534	he	129	“ We do n’t want no dessert . ”
55756	55771	55773	55773	Cecil	210	“ things that came out of nothing and meant she did n’t know what . ”
55807	55813	55802	55803	the reader	1615	“ She loves young Emerson . ”
55840	55842	55864	55865	the reader	1615	“ nerves ”
55943	55948	55950	55951	Mr. Beebe	120	“ A nice fellow , ”
55953	55974	55975	55975	Lucy	115	“ He will work off his crudities in time . I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully . ”
55978	55989	55975	55975	Lucy	115	“ He seems in better spirits . He laughs more . ”
55990	55993	55995	55996	the clergyman	368	“ Yes , ”
55998	56004	55995	55996	the clergyman	368	“ He is waking up . ”
56140	56147	56149	56150	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I shall never forgive myself , ”
56172	56201	56149	56150	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I have upset everything . Bursting in on young people ! But I insist on paying for my cab up . Grant that , at any rate . ”
56202	56211	56213	56213	Lucy	115	“ Our visitors never do such dreadful things , ”
56235	56256	56216	56217	her brother	866	“ Just what I ’ve been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of , Lucy , for the last half hour . ”
56257	56267	56269	56270	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor , ”
56279	56301	56269	56270	Miss Bartlett	114	“ All right , if you ’d really rather . Five shillings , and I gave a bob to the driver . ”
56344	56355	56335	56336	Miss Bartlett	114	“ But who am I to give the sovereign to ? ”
56356	56367	56369	56369	Lucy	115	“ Let ’s leave it all till mother comes back , ”
56371	56409	56369	56369	Lucy	115	“ No , dear ; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me . We all have our little foibles , and mine is the prompt settling of accounts . ”
56480	56512	56586	56587	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Please — please — I know I am a sad spoil - sport , but it would make me wretched . I should practically be robbing the one who lost . ”
56513	56520	56522	56522	Cecil	210	“ Freddy owes me fifteen shillings , ”
56524	56539	56522	56522	Cecil	210	“ So it will work out right if you give the pound to me . ”
56540	56544	56546	56547	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Fifteen shillings , ”
56550	56558	56546	56547	Miss Bartlett	114	“ How is that , Mr. Vyse ? ”
56559	56585	56586	56587	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Because , do n’t you see , Freddy paid your cab . Give me the pound , and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling . ”
56656	56664	56666	56669	Minnie Beebe who had	241	“ But I do n’t see that ! ”
56676	56690	56666	56669	Minnie Beebe who had	241	“ I do n’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the quid . ”
56691	56701	56702	56702	they	1640	“ Because of the fifteen shillings and the five , ”
56706	56719	56702	56702	they	1640	“ Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound , you see . ”
56720	56727	56728	56728	They	1640	“ But I do n’t see — ”
56736	56807	56728	56728	They	1640	“ No , thank you . I ’m done . I do n’t see why — Freddy , do n’t poke me . Miss Honeychurch , your brother ’s hurting me . Ow ! What about Mr. Floyd ’s ten shillings ? Ow ! No , I do n’t see and I never shall see why Miss What’s - her - name should n’t pay that bob for the driver . ”
56808	56815	56817	56818	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I had forgotten the driver , ”
56822	56848	56817	56818	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Thank you , dear , for reminding me . A shilling was it ? Can any one give me change for half a crown ? ”
56849	56855	56857	56859	the young hostess	1641	“ I ’ll get it , ”
56865	56901	56857	56859	the young hostess	1641	“ Cecil , give me that sovereign . No , give me up that sovereign . I ’ll get Euphemia to change it , and we ’ll start the whole thing again from the beginning . ”
56902	56913	56915	56916	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Lucy — Lucy — what a nuisance I am ! ”
56948	56957	56938	56939	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Have you told him about him yet ? ”
56958	56965	56967	56967	Lucy	115	“ No , I have n’t , ”
56985	56997	56998	56998	She	115	“ Let me see — a sovereign ’s worth of silver . ”
57048	57060	57061	57061	she	114	“ No , I have n’t told Cecil or any one , ”
57068	57103	57061	57061	she	114	“ I promised you I should n’t . Here is your money — all shillings , except two half - crowns . Would you count it ? You can settle your debt nicely now . ”
57127	57131	57132	57132	she	114	“ How dreadful ! ”
57135	57155	57132	57132	she	114	“ how more than dreadful , if Mr. Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source . ”
57156	57163	57165	57166	the girl	369	“ Oh , no , Charlotte , ”
57172	57186	57165	57166	the girl	369	“ George Emerson is all right , and what other source is there ? ”
57191	57217	57187	57188	Miss Bartlett	114	“ For instance , the driver . I saw him looking through the bushes at you , remember he had a violet between his teeth . ”
57223	57252	57218	57218	Lucy	115	“ We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we are n’t careful . How could a Florentine cab - driver ever get hold of Cecil ? ”
57253	57261	57165	57166	the girl	369	“ We must think of every possibility . ”
57262	57270	57165	57166	the girl	369	“ Oh , it ’s all right . ”
57271	57288	57218	57218	Lucy	115	“ Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows . In fact , he is certain to know . ”
57289	57327	57165	57166	the girl	369	“ I do n’t care if he does . I was grateful to you for your letter , but even if the news does get round , I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it . ”
57328	57333	57165	57166	the girl	369	“ To contradict it ? ”
57334	57342	57218	57218	Lucy	115	“ No , to laugh at it . ”
57362	57390	57357	57357	he	1649	“ Very well , dear , you know best . Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young . Ladies are certainly different . ”
57391	57396	57397	57397	She	115	“ Now , Charlotte ! ”
57403	57441	57397	57397	She	115	“ You kind , anxious thing . Whatwouldyou have me do ? First you say ‘ Do n’t tell ’ ; and then you say , ‘ Tell ’ . Which is it to be ? Quick ! ”
57445	57495	57442	57443	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I am no match for you in conversation , dearest . I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence , and you so well able to look after yourself , and so much cleverer in all ways than I am . You will never forgive me . ”
57496	57515	57442	57443	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Shall we go out , then . They will smash all the china if we do n’t . ”
57534	57559	57524	57524	Minnie	241	“ Dear , one moment — we may not have this chance for a chat again . Have you seen the young one yet ? ”
57560	57566	57442	57443	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Yes , I have . ”
57567	57571	57442	57443	Miss Bartlett	114	“ What happened ? ”
57572	57579	57524	57524	Minnie	241	“ We met at the Rectory . ”
57580	57588	57442	57443	Miss Bartlett	114	“ What line is he taking up ? ”
57589	57646	57442	57443	Miss Bartlett	114	“ No line . He talked about Italy , like any other person . It is really all right . What advantage would he get from being a cad , to put it bluntly ? I do wish I could make you see it my way . He really wo n’t be any nuisance , Charlotte . ”
57647	57662	57663	57663	Lucy	115	“ Once a cad , always a cad . That is my poor opinion . ”
57666	57693	57694	57694	She	115	“ Cecil said one day — and I thought it so profound — that there are two kinds of cads — the conscious and the subconscious . ”
57744	57753	57755	57756	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Once a cad , always a cad , ”
57758	57938	57939	57939	She	1653	“ What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head . I fell into all those violets , and he was silly and surprised . I do n’t think we ought to blame him very much . It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly . It really does ; it makes an enormous difference , and he lost his head : he does n’t admire me , or any of that nonsense , one straw . Freddy rather likes him , and has asked him up here on Sunday , so you can judge for yourself . He has improved ; he does n’t always look as if he ’s going to burst into tears . He is a clerk in the General Manager ’s office at one of the big railways — not a porter ! and runs down to his father for week - ends . Papa was to do with journalism , but is rheumatic and has retired . There ! Now for the garden . ”
57949	57980	57939	57939	She	1653	“ Suppose we do n’t talk about this silly Italian business any more . We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner , with no worriting . ”
58196	58203	58205	58205	I	0	“ The men say they wo n’t go”—“Well
58209	58212	58214	58214	she	1653	them”—Minnie says , “
58215	58219	58221	58221	Mary	226	go?”—“Tell her , no nonsense”—“Anne
58225	58237	58224	58224	me	0	behind!”—“Dearest Lucia , may I trespass upon you for a pin ? ”
58492	58519	58474	58474	she	115	“ Lucy ! Lucy ! What ’s that book ? Who ’s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil ? ”
58520	58533	58474	58474	she	115	“ It ’s only the library book that Cecil ’s been reading . ”
58534	58550	58551	58551	Lucy	115	“ But pick it up , and do n’t stand idling there like a flamingo . ”
58638	58649	58634	58634	Cecil	210	“ What ! you are n’t forgetting your Italy already ? ”
58685	58700	58701	58701	She	115	“ Lucy — have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself ? ”
58718	58784	58712	58712	herself	484	“ It ’s a special collection — I forget what for . I do beg , no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies ; see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence . Where is the child ? Minnie ! That book ’s all warped . ( Gracious , how plain you look ! ) Put it under the Atlas to press . Minnie ! ”
58785	58791	58894	58894	she	1680	“ Oh , Mrs. Honeychurch — ”
58797	58808	58705	58706	her mother	484	“ Minnie , do n’t be late . Here comes the horse”—it
58818	58859	58705	58706	her mother	484	“ Where ’s Charlotte ? Run up and hurry her . Why is she so long ? She had nothing to do . She never brings anything but blouses . Poor Charlotte — How I do detest blouses ! Minnie ! ”
58949	58978	58931	58932	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Dear Marian , I am very sorry , but I have no small change — nothing but sovereigns and half crowns . Could any one give me — ”
58979	59007	58919	58920	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Yes , easily . Jump in . Gracious me , how smart you look ! What a lovely frock ! You put us all to shame . ”
59008	59027	59029	59030	Miss Bartlett	114	“ If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now , when should I wear them ? ”
59059	59067	59070	59070	Cecil	210	“ Good - bye ! Be good ! ”
59087	59092	59101	59101	He	210	“ church and so on ”
59238	59242	59244	59245	her mother	484	“ Introduce me , ”
59247	59259	59260	59260	He	210	“ Unless the young man considers that he knows me already . ”
59342	59346	59347	59347	he	289	“ Very much , ”
59372	59407	59369	59369	He	289	“ We find , though , that the Miss Alans were coming , and that we have turned them out . Women mind such a thing . I am very much upset about it . ”
59408	59417	59419	59420	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ I believe that there was some misunderstanding , ”
59423	59438	59440	59440	George	119	“ Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person , ”
59451	59463	59440	59440	George	119	“ He thought we should be artistic . He is disappointed . ”
59464	59489	59490	59490	He	289	“ And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up . What do you think ? ”
59495	59504	59506	59506	Lucy	115	“ Oh , stop now you have come , ”
59533	59557	59506	59506	Lucy	115	“ So George says . He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall . Yet it does seem so unkind . ”
59558	59571	59573	59573	George	119	“ There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world , ”
59587	59590	59592	59593	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Yes ! ”
59595	59614	59592	59593	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ That ’s exactly what I say . Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans ? ”
59615	59634	59635	59635	he	289	“ There is a certain amount of kindness , just as there is a certain amount of light , ”
59641	59710	59635	59635	he	289	“ We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand , and it is no good moving from place to place to save things ; because the shadow always follows . Choose a place where you wo n’t do harm — yes , choose a place where you wo n’t do very much harm , and stand in it for all you are worth , facing the sunshine . ”
59711	59723	59592	59593	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Oh , Mr. Emerson , I see you ’re clever ! ”
59724	59728	59635	59635	he	289	“ Eh — ? ”
59729	59752	59753	59753	George	119	“ I see you ’re going to be clever . I hope you did n’t go behaving like that to poor Freddy . ”
59772	59779	59780	59780	he	289	“ No , I did n’t , ”
59783	59813	59780	59780	he	289	“ He behaved that way to me . It is his philosophy . Only he starts life with it ; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first . ”
59814	59852	59910	59910	her	1703	“ Whatdoyou mean ? No , never mind what you mean . Do n’t explain . He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon . Do you play tennis ? Do you mind tennis on Sunday — ? ”
59853	59870	59780	59780	he	289	“ George mind tennis on Sunday ! George , after his education , distinguish between Sunday — ”
59871	59907	59910	59910	her	1703	“ Very well , George does n’t mind tennis on Sunday . No more do I. That ’s settled . Mr. Emerson , if you could come with your son we should be so pleased . ”
59933	59948	59928	59928	She	1703	“ And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans . ”
59949	59953	59955	59955	George	119	“ I know , ”
60017	60026	60028	60029	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ You know our cousin , Miss Bartlett , ”
60032	60042	60028	60029	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ You met her with my daughter in Florence . ”
60043	60048	60050	60052	the old man	346	“ Yes , indeed ! ”
60148	60162	60145	60145	He	119	“ I — I’ll come up to tennis if I can manage it , ”
60254	60261	60263	60264	his father	383	“ George , do n’t go , ”
60282	60305	60306	60306	Lucy	115	“ George has been in such good spirits today , and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon . ”
60322	60325	60326	60326	she	115	“ Yes , ”
60333	60340	60326	60326	she	115	“ I do hope he will . ”
60350	60366	60342	60342	she	115	“ The old man has n’t been told ; I knew it was all right . ”
60434	60445	60446	60446	Her	115	“ He has not told , he has not told . ”
60452	60484	60485	60485	She	115	“ He has not told his father — to whom he tells all things . It was not an exploit . He did not laugh at me when I had gone . ”
60493	60519	60485	60485	She	115	“ He does not love me . No . How terrible if he did ! But he has not told . He will not tell . ”
60527	60548	60520	60520	She	115	“ It is all right . It ’s a secret between us two for ever . Cecil will never hear . ”
60630	60644	60627	60627	she	115	“ The Emersons have been so nice . George Emerson has improved enormously . ”
60645	60651	60653	60653	Cecil	210	“ How are my protégés ? ”
60680	60683	60684	60684	she	115	“ Protégés ! ”
60721	60754	60755	60755	She	115	“ You shall see for yourself how your protégés are . George Emerson is coming up this afternoon . He is a most interesting man to talk to . Only do n’t — ”
60759	60765	60755	60755	She	115	“ Do n’t protect him . ”
60844	60868	60836	60842	a Being who whispered to her soul	1737	“ It will not last , this cheerfulness . In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men . ”
61003	61016	61017	61017	She	115	“ Now play us the other garden — the one in Parsifal . ”
61022	61027	61029	61030	her mother	484	“ Not very dutiful , ”
61058	61066	61067	61067	she	115	“ Oh , I had no idea ! ”
61101	61109	61111	61112	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Our performer has changed her mind , ”
61159	61164	61166	61166	Freddy	129	“ I vote tennis , ”
61174	61180	61166	61166	Freddy	129	“ Yes , so do I. ”
61189	61199	61183	61183	she	115	“ I vote you have a men ’s four . ”
61200	61204	61156	61156	she	115	“ All right . ”
61205	61213	61215	61215	Cecil	210	“ Not for me , thank you , ”
61217	61225	61226	61226	He	210	“ I will not spoil the set . ”
61247	61270	61271	61271	George	119	“ Oh , come along Cecil . I ’m bad , Floyd ’s rotten , and so I dare say ’s Emerson . ”
61275	61281	61271	61271	George	119	“ I am not bad . ”
61291	61299	61301	61301	Cecil	210	“ Then certainly I wo n’t play , ”
61318	61338	61311	61311	she	114	“ I agree with you , Mr. Vyse . You had much better not play . Much better not . ”
61355	61369	61339	61339	Minnie	241	“ I shall miss every ball anyway , so what does it matter ? ”
61381	61390	61392	61393	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Then it will have to be Lucy , ”
61395	61420	61392	61393	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ you must fall back on Lucy . There is no other way out of it . Lucy , go and change your frock . ”
61581	61592	61567	61567	he	210	“ I shall want to live , I tell you . ”
61794	61808	61781	61781	He	210	“ I say , listen to this , Lucy . Three split infinitives . ”
61809	61812	61814	61814	Lucy	115	“ Dreadful ! ”
61870	61878	61865	61867	the other two	1766	“ The scene is laid in Florence . ”
61879	61900	61901	61901	She	115	“ What fun , Cecil ! Read away . Come , Mr. Emerson , sit down after all your energy . ”
61903	61905	61909	61909	she	115	“ forgiven ”
61937	61945	61924	61924	He	210	“ You — and are you tired ? ”
61946	61953	61989	61989	She	115	“ Of course I ’m not ! ”
61954	61961	61962	61962	She	115	“ Do you mind being beaten ? ”
61968	61971	61962	61962	She	115	“ No , ”
61985	61988	61989	61989	She	115	“ Yes . ”
61993	62017	61989	61989	She	115	“ I do n’t seeyou’resuch a splendid player , though . The light was behind you , and it was in my eyes . ”
62018	62025	61989	61989	She	115	“ I never said I was . ”
62026	62032	61989	61989	She	115	“ Why , you did ! ”
62033	62039	61989	61989	She	115	“ You did n’t attend . ”
62040	62071	61989	61989	She	115	“ You said — oh , do n’t go in for accuracy at this house . We all exaggerate , and we get very angry with people who do n’t . ”
62072	62082	62084	62084	Cecil	210	“ ‘ The scene is laid in Florence , ’ ”
62095	62104	62105	62105	Lucy	115	“ ‘ Sunset . Leonora was speeding — ’ ”
62108	62122	62105	62105	Lucy	115	“ Leonora ? Is Leonora the heroine ? Who ’s the book by ? ”
62123	62173	62174	62174	Lucy	115	“ Joseph Emery Prank . ‘ Sunset . Leonora speeding across the square . Pray the saints she might not arrive too late . Sunset — the sunset of Italy . Under Orcagna ’s Loggia — the Loggia de ’ Lanzi , as we sometimes call it now — ’ ”
62179	62211	62174	62174	Lucy	115	“ ‘ Joseph Emery Prank ’ indeed ! Why it ’s Miss Lavish ! It ’s Miss Lavish ’s novel , and she ’s publishing it under somebody else ’s name . ”
62212	62219	62105	62105	Lucy	115	“ Who may Miss Lavish be ? ”
62220	62235	62242	62242	she	115	“ Oh , a dreadful person — Mr. Emerson , you remember Miss Lavish ? ”
62251	62279	62247	62247	George	119	“ Of course I do . I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street . It was she who told me that you lived here . ”
62280	62286	62287	62287	She	115	“ Were n’t you pleased ? ”
62289	62295	62287	62287	She	115	“ to see Miss Lavish , ”
62339	62347	62348	62348	she	115	“ No wonder the novel ’s bad , ”
62351	62372	62348	62348	she	115	“ I never liked Miss Lavish . But I suppose one ought to read it as one ’s met her . ”
62373	62380	62382	62382	Cecil	210	“ All modern books are bad , ”
62398	62408	62382	62382	Cecil	210	“ Every one writes for money in these days . ”
62409	62415	62348	62348	she	115	“ Oh , Cecil — ! ”
62416	62432	62433	62433	Cecil	210	“ It is so . I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer . ”
62516	62529	62505	62505	herself	115	“ How do you like this view of ours , Mr. Emerson ? ”
62530	62539	62478	62478	his	119	“ I never notice much difference in views . ”
62540	62546	62481	62481	him	119	“ What do you mean ? ”
62547	62565	62505	62505	herself	115	“ Because they ’re all alike . Because all that matters in them is distance and air . ”
62566	62569	62571	62571	Cecil	210	“ H’m ! ”
62582	62584	62591	62591	he	119	“ My father”—he
62595	62628	62591	62591	he	119	flushed)—“says that there is only one perfect view — the view of the sky straight over our heads , and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it . ”
62629	62639	62641	62641	Cecil	210	“ I expect your father has been reading Dante , ”
62656	62705	62706	62706	Lucy	115	“ He told us another day that views are really crowds — crowds of trees and houses and hills — and are bound to resemble each other , like human crowds — and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural , for the same reason . ”
62711	62746	62747	62747	He	210	“ For a crowd is more than the people who make it up . Something gets added to it — no one knows how — just as something has got added to those hills . ”
62757	62763	62764	62764	she	115	“ What a splendid idea ! ”
62767	62787	62764	62764	she	115	“ I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again . I ’m so sorry he ’s not so well . ”
62788	62796	62747	62747	He	210	“ No , he is n’t well . ”
62797	62810	62812	62812	Cecil	210	“ There ’s an absurd account of a view in this book , ”
62814	62838	62812	62812	Cecil	210	“ Also that men fall into two classes — those who forget views and those who remember them , even in small rooms . ”
62839	62850	62747	62747	He	210	“ Mr. Emerson , have you any brothers or sisters ? ”
62851	62856	62747	62747	He	210	“ None . Why ? ”
62857	62865	62812	62812	Cecil	210	“ You spoke of ‘ us . ’ ”
62866	62874	62875	62875	Cecil	210	“ My mother , I was meaning . ”
62883	62894	62875	62875	Cecil	210	“ Oh , Cecil — how you made me jump ! ”
62895	62907	62812	62812	Cecil	210	“ I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer . ”
62908	62939	62940	62940	Cecil	210	“ I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead . It is the first thing that I remember . ”
62978	62989	62972	62972	Lucy	115	“ Cecil , do read the thing about the view . ”
62990	63001	63036	63036	Cecil	210	“ Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us . ”
63002	63033	62972	62972	Lucy	115	“ No — read away . I think nothing ’s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud . If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous , he can go . ”
63063	63073	63058	63058	he	210	“ Mr. Emerson , go and find tennis balls . ”
63129	63136	63138	63138	George	119	“ Am I really to go ? ”
63140	63148	63149	63149	she	115	“ No , of course not really , ”
63152	63156	63158	63158	Cecil	210	“ Chapter two , ”
63162	63175	63158	63158	Cecil	210	“ Find me chapter two , if it is n’t bothering you . ”
63196	63204	63207	63207	her	115	“ Here — hand me the book . ”
63211	63241	63207	63207	her	115	“ It is n’t worth reading — it ’s too silly to read — I never saw such rubbish — it ought n’t to be allowed to be printed . ”
63249	63254	63255	63255	he	210	“ ‘ Leonora , ’ ”
63258	63288	63255	63255	he	210	“ ‘ sat pensive and alone . Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany , dotted over with many a smiling village . The season was spring . ’ ”
63314	63321	63322	63322	he	210	“ ‘ A golden haze , ’ ”
63328	63358	63325	63325	He	210	“ ‘ Afar off the towers of Florence , while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets . All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her — ’ ”
63377	63418	63374	63374	He	210	“ ‘ There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use . No eloquence was his , nor did he suffer from the lack of it . He simply enfolded her in his manly arms . ’ ”
63419	63428	63429	63429	he	210	“ This is n’t the passage I wanted , ”
63433	63443	63444	63444	He	210	“ there is another much funnier , further on . ”
63450	63458	63460	63460	Lucy	115	“ Should we go in to tea ? ”
63538	63541	63542	63542	she	115	“ No — ”
63629	63647	63624	63624	She	115	“ I am not coming in to tea — tell mother — I must write some letters , ”
63779	63784	63790	63790	she	115	“ conquered her breakdown . ”
63875	63882	63883	63883	she	115	“ Something too awful has happened , ”
63893	63904	63883	63883	she	115	“ Do you know anything about Miss Lavish ’s novel ? ”
63935	63956	63929	63933	a reticent woman at heart	1786	“ There is a scene in it . The hero and heroine make love . Do you know about that ? ”
63957	63961	63913	63913	she	114	“ Dear — ? ”
63962	63971	63972	63972	she	115	“ Do you know about it , please ? ”
63975	63989	63972	63972	she	115	“ They are on a hillside , and Florence is in the distance . ”
63990	64008	63913	63913	she	114	“ My good Lucia , I am all at sea . I know nothing about it whatever . ”
64009	64041	63913	63913	she	114	“ There are violets . I can not believe it is a coincidence . Charlotte , Charlotte , howcouldyou have told her ? I have thought before speaking ; itmustbe you . ”
64042	64047	64048	64048	she	115	“ Told her what ? ”
64055	64063	64048	64048	she	115	“ About that dreadful afternoon in February . ”
64070	64087	64088	64088	Lucy	115	“ Oh , Lucy , dearest girl — she has n’t put that in her book ? ”
64091	64102	64088	64088	Lucy	115	“ Not so that one could recognize it . Yes . ”
64103	64120	63913	63913	she	114	“ Then never — never — never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine . ”
64121	64127	63913	63913	she	114	“ So you did tell ? ”
64128	64149	64088	64088	Lucy	115	“ I did just happen — when I had tea with her at Rome — in the course of conversation — ”
64150	64183	63913	63913	she	114	“ But Charlotte — what about the promise you gave me when we were packing ? Why did you tell Miss Lavish , when you would n’t even let me tell mother ? ”
64184	64197	63913	63913	she	114	“ I will never forgive Eleanor . She has betrayed my confidence . ”
64198	64214	64088	64088	Lucy	115	“ Why did you tell her , though ? This is a most serious thing . ”
64275	64329	64270	64270	Lucy	115	“ Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson ; it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again . Behind Cecil ’s back . Ugh ! Is it possible that men are such brutes ? Behind Cecil ’s back as we were walking up the garden . ”
64340	64353	64330	64331	Miss Bartlett	114	“ What is to be done now ? Can you tell me ? ”
64354	64376	64270	64270	Lucy	115	“ Oh , Lucy — I shall never forgive myself , never to my dying day . Fancy if your prospects — ”
64377	64381	64383	64383	Lucy	115	“ I know , ”
64390	64429	64383	64383	Lucy	115	“ I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil , and what you meant by ‘ some other source . ’ You knew that you had told Miss Lavish , and that she was not reliable . ”
64439	64442	64444	64445	the girl	369	“ However , ”
64453	64479	64444	64445	the girl	369	“ What ’s done ’s done . You have put me in a most awkward position . How am I to get out of it ? ”
64525	64612	64510	64510	She	114	“ He must — that man must have such a setting down that he wo n’t forget . And who ’s to give it him ? I ca n’t tell mother now — owing to you . Nor Cecil , Charlotte , owing to you . I am caught up every way . I think I shall go mad . I have no one to help me . That ’s why I ’ve sent for you . What ’s wanted is a man with a whip . ”
64625	64654	64617	64617	one	2114	“ Yes — but it ’s no good agreeing . What ’s to bedone?We women go maundering on . Whatdoesa girl do when she comes across a cad ? ”
64655	64692	64617	64617	one	2114	“ I always said he was a cad , dear . Give me credit for that , at all events . From the very first moment — when he said his father was having a bath . ”
64693	64743	64744	64745	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Oh , bother the credit and who ’s been right or wrong ! We ’ve both made a muddle of it . George Emerson is still down the garden there , and is he to be left unpunished , or is n’t he ? I want to know . ”
64786	64811	64766	64766	She	114	“ You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome . Ca n’t you speak again to him now ? ”
64812	64821	64777	64778	the cad	1796	“ Willingly would I move heaven and earth — ”
64822	64829	64831	64831	Lucy	115	“ I want something more definite , ”
64834	64861	64831	64831	Lucy	115	“ Will you speak to him ? It is the least you can do , surely , considering it all happened because you broke your word . ”
64862	64874	64777	64778	the cad	1796	“ Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine . ”
64882	64893	64880	64880	herself	185	“ Yes or no , please ; yes or no . ”
64894	64908	64909	64910	George Emerson	119	“ It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle . ”
64924	64928	64930	64930	Lucy	115	“ Very well , ”
64937	64951	64930	64930	Lucy	115	“ No one will help me . I will speak to him myself . ”
64967	64972	64974	64974	Freddy	129	“ Hullo , Emerson ! ”
64978	64991	64974	64974	Freddy	129	“ Found the lost ball ? Good man ! Want any tea ? ”
65005	65021	65022	65022	They	1801	“ Oh , Lucy , but that is brave of you ! I admire you — ”
65085	65125	65073	65073	She	115	“ Freddy has taken him into the dining - room . The others are going down the garden . Come . Let us get this over quickly . Come . I want you in the room , of course . ”
65126	65135	65073	65073	She	115	“ Lucy , do you mind doing it ? ”
65136	65146	65171	65171	Lucy	115	“ How can you ask such a ridiculous question ? ”
65147	65151	65152	65152	She	115	“ Poor Lucy — ”
65158	65170	65152	65152	She	115	“ I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go . ”
65223	65228	65229	65229	Freddy	129	“ Try the jam , ”
65233	65240	65229	65229	Freddy	129	“ The jam ’s jolly good . ”
65267	65274	65261	65261	he	119	“ No — nothing to eat . ”
65275	65283	65285	65285	Lucy	115	“ You go down to the others , ”
65287	65303	65285	65285	Lucy	115	“ Charlotte and I will give Mr. Emerson all he wants . Where ’s mother ? ”
65304	65321	65261	65261	he	119	“ She ’s started on her Sunday writing . She ’s in the drawing - room . ”
65322	65332	65333	65333	He	119	“ That ’s all right . You go away . ”
65376	65413	65372	65372	She	114	“ I ca n’t have it , Mr. Emerson . I can not even talk to you . Go out of this house , and never come into it again as long as I live here — ”
65424	65433	65372	65372	She	114	“ I hate a row . Go please . ”
65434	65437	65372	65372	She	114	“ What — ”
65438	65442	65372	65372	She	114	“ No discussion . ”
65443	65449	65450	65450	She	114	“ But I ca n’t — ”
65455	65470	65452	65452	her	114	“ Go , please . I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse . ”
65471	65477	65478	65478	he	1807	“ You do n’t mean , ”
65484	65497	65483	65483	Miss	1808	Bartlett—“you do n’t mean that you are going to marry that man ? ”
65515	65521	65522	65522	she	114	“ You are merely ridiculous , ”
65534	65570	65527	65527	his	1807	“ You can not live with Vyse . He ’s only for an acquaintance . He is for society and cultivated talk . He should know no one intimately , least of all a woman . ”
65581	65592	65527	65527	his	1807	“ Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired ? ”
65593	65599	65527	65527	his	1807	“ I can scarcely discuss — ”
65600	65976	65977	65977	Lucy	115	“ No , but have you ever ? He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things — books , pictures — but kill when they come to people . That ’s why I ’ll speak out through all this muddle even now . It ’s shocking enough to lose you in any case , but generally a man must deny himself joy , and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person . I would never have let myself go . But I saw him first in the National Gallery , when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters . Then he brings us here , and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour . That is the man all over — playing tricks on people , on the most sacred form of life that he can find . Next , I meet you together , and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked , when it was foryouto settle whether you were shocked or no . Cecil all over again . He dare n’t let a woman decide . He ’s the type who ’s kept Europe back for a thousand years . Every moment of his life he ’s forming you , telling you what ’s charming or amusing or ladylike , telling you what a man thinks womanly ; and you , you of all women , listen to his voice instead of to your own . So it was at the Rectory , when I met you both again ; so it has been the whole of this afternoon . Therefore — not ‘ therefore I kissed you , ’ because the book made me do that , and I wish to goodness I had more self - control . I ’m not ashamed . I do n’t apologize . But it has frightened you , and you may not have noticed that I love you . Or would you have told me to go , and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly ? But therefore — therefore I settled to fight him . ”
65985	66011	66013	66013	he	1809	“ You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him , Mr. Emerson . Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit . ”
66027	66033	66024	66024	He	1809	“ Yes , I have , ”
66042	66094	66095	66095	He	1809	“ I ’m the same kind of brute at bottom . This desire to govern a woman — it lies very deep , and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden . But I do love you surely in a better way than he does . ”
66098	66124	66125	66125	He	1809	“ Yes — really in a better way . I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms . ”
66131	66241	66125	66125	He	1809	“ Lucy , be quick — there ’s no time for us to talk now — come to me as you came in the spring , and afterwards I will be gentle and explain . I have cared for you since that man died . I can not live without you , ‘ No good , ’ I thought ; ‘ she is marrying someone else ’ ; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun . As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered . I called . I wanted to live and have my chance of joy . ”
66242	66247	66249	66249	Lucy	115	“ And Mr. Vyse ? ”
66256	66282	66249	66249	Lucy	115	“ Does he not matter ? That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly ? A detail of no importance , I suppose ? ”
66294	66307	66284	66284	he	1811	“ May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition ? ”
66311	66326	66330	66330	he	1811	“ It is our last chance . I shall do all that I can . ”
66354	66367	66368	66368	he	1811	“ You would n’t stop us this second time if you understood , ”
66371	66394	66368	66368	he	1811	“ I have been into the dark , and I am going back into it , unless you will try to understand . ”
66417	66423	66424	66424	he	1811	“ It is being young , ”
66440	66461	66424	66424	he	1811	“ It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really . It is that love and youth matter intellectually . ”
66563	66579	66557	66557	they	1813	“ Oh , Lucia — come back here — oh , what an awful man ! ”
66591	66598	66599	66599	she	115	“ Well , he amuses me , ”
66602	66655	66599	66599	she	115	“ Either I ’m mad , or else he is , and I ’m inclined to think it ’s the latter . One more fuss through with you , Charlotte . Many thanks . I think , though , that this is the last . My admirer will hardly trouble me again . ”
66666	66718	66657	66658	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Well , it is n’t everyone who could boast such a conquest , dearest , is it ? Oh , one ought n’t to laugh , really . It might have been very serious . But you were so sensible and brave — so unlike the girls of my day . ”
66719	66727	66657	66658	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Let ’s go down to them . ”
66831	66850	66992	66992	He	210	“ Hullo , Lucy ! There ’s still light enough for another set , if you two’ll hurry . ”
66851	66859	66992	66992	He	210	“ Mr. Emerson has had to go . ”
66860	66903	66904	66904	Cecil	210	“ What a nuisance ! That spoils the four . I say , Cecil , do play , do , there ’s a good chap . It ’s Floyd ’s last day . Do play tennis with us , just this once . ”
66909	66959	66904	66904	Cecil	210	“ My dear Freddy , I am no athlete . As you well remarked this very morning , ‘ There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books ’ ; I plead guilty to being such a chap , and will not inflict myself on you . ”
67084	67092	67093	67093	she	115	“ I am very sorry about it , ”
67096	67130	67093	67093	she	115	“ I have carefully thought things over . We are too different . I must ask you to release me , and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl . ”
67151	67158	67146	67146	her	115	“ Different — how — how — ”
67159	67173	67174	67174	she	115	“ I have n’t had a really good education , for one thing , ”
67185	67223	67174	67174	she	115	“ My Italian trip came too late , and I am forgetting all that I learnt there . I shall never be able to talk to your friends , or behave as a wife of yours should . ”
67224	67243	67146	67146	her	115	“ I do n’t understand you . You are n’t like yourself . You ’re tired , Lucy . ”
67244	67247	67248	67248	she	115	“ Tired ! ”
67255	67273	67248	67248	she	115	“ That is exactly like you . You always think women do n’t mean what they say . ”
67274	67288	67146	67146	her	115	“ Well , you sound tired , as if something has worried you . ”
67289	67322	67146	67146	her	115	“ What if I do ? It does n’t prevent me from realizing the truth . I ca n’t marry you , and you will thank me for saying so some day . ”
67323	67332	67333	67333	she	115	“ You had that bad headache yesterday — All right”—for
67338	67356	67333	67333	she	115	“ I see it ’s much more than headaches . But give me a moment ’s time . ”
67362	67417	67357	67357	He	1820	“ You must excuse me if I say stupid things , but my brain has gone to pieces . Part of it lives three minutes back , when I was sure that you loved me , and the other part — I find it difficult — I am likely to say the wrong thing . ”
67453	67515	67450	67450	she	115	“ There are days when one sees clearly , and this is one of them . Things must come to a breaking - point some time , and it happens to be to - day . If you want to know , quite a little thing decided me to speak to you — when you would n’t play tennis with Freddy . ”
67516	67523	67525	67525	Cecil	210	“ I never do play tennis , ”
67530	67545	67525	67525	Cecil	210	“ I never could play . I do n’t understand a word you say . ”
67546	67566	67450	67450	she	115	“ You can play well enough to make up a four . I thought it abominably selfish of you . ”
67567	67612	67450	67450	she	115	“ No , I can’t — well , never mind the tennis . Why could n’t you — couldn’t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong ? You talked of our wedding at lunch — at least , you let me talk . ”
67613	67621	67623	67623	Lucy	115	“ I knew you would n’t understand , ”
67627	67676	67623	67623	Lucy	115	“ I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations . Of course , it is n’t the tennis — that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks . Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain . ”
67682	67788	67677	67677	She	115	“ Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife — for instance , in London ; and are you fitted to be my husband ? I do n’t think so . You do n’t like Freddy , nor my mother . There was always a lot against our engagement , Cecil , but all our relations seemed pleased , and we met so often , and it was no good mentioning it until — well , until all things came to a point . They have to - day . I see clearly . I must speak . That ’s all . ”
67789	67798	67800	67800	Cecil	210	“ I can not think you were right , ”
67803	67835	67800	67800	Cecil	210	“ I can not tell why , but though all that you say sounds true , I feel that you are not treating me fairly . It ’s all too horrible . ”
67836	67845	67677	67677	She	115	“ What ’s the good of a scene ? ”
67846	67862	67863	67863	He	210	“ No good . But surely I have a right to hear a little more . ”
67903	67907	67677	67677	She	115	“ little more , ”
67914	67939	67940	67940	He	210	“ Do n’t open the window ; and you ’d better draw the curtain , too ; Freddy or any one might be outside . ”
67943	67988	67940	67940	He	210	“ I really think we had better go to bed , if you do n’t mind . I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards . As you say it is all too horrible , and it is no good talking . ”
68072	68086	68069	68069	he	210	“ But I love you , and I did think you loved me ! ”
68087	68092	68093	68093	she	1821	“ I did not , ”
68096	68120	68093	68093	she	1821	“ I thought I did at first . I am sorry , and ought to have refused you this last time , too . ”
68176	68206	68164	68164	she	1821	“ You do n’t love me , evidently . I dare say you are right not to . But it would hurt a little less if I knew why . ”
68207	68208	68234	68234	his	210	“ Because”—a
68217	68228	68164	68164	she	1821	it—“you’re the sort who ca n’t know any one intimately . ”
68237	68292	68293	68293	Her	1821	“ I do n’t mean exactly that . But you will question me , though I beg you not to , and I must say something . It is that , more or less . When we were only acquaintances , you let me be myself , but now you ’re always protecting me . ”
68297	68369	68293	68293	Her	1821	“ I wo n’t be protected . I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right . To shield me is an insult . Ca n’t I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second - hand through you ? A woman ’s place ! You despise my mother — I know you do — because she ’s conventional and bothers over puddings ; but , oh goodness!”—she
68373	68472	68473	68473	She	1821	feet—“conventional , Cecil , you ’re that , for you may understand beautiful things , but you do n’t know how to use them ; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music , and would try to wrap up me . I wo n’t be stifled , not by the most glorious music , for people are more glorious , and you hide them from me . That ’s why I break off my engagement . You were all right as long as you kept to things , but when you came to people — ”
68488	68493	68482	68482	Cecil	210	“ It is true . ”
68494	68500	68501	68501	she	1821	“ True on the whole , ”
68510	68525	68501	68501	she	1821	“ True , every word . It is a revelation . It is — I. ”
68526	68539	68540	68540	He	210	“ Anyhow , those are my reasons for not being your wife . ”
68543	68591	68540	68540	He	210	“ ‘ The sort that can know no one intimately . ’ It is true . I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged . I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother . You are even greater than I thought . ”
68597	68706	68592	68592	She	1821	“ I ’m not going to worry you . You are far too good to me . I shall never forget your insight ; and , dear , I only blame you for this : you might have warned me in the early stages , before you felt you would n’t marry me , and so have given me a chance to improve . I have never known you till this evening . I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be . But this evening you are a different person : new thoughts — even a new voice — ”
68707	68717	68718	68718	she	1825	“ What do you mean by a new voice ? ”
68726	68738	68740	68740	he	1826	“ I mean that a new person seems speaking through you , ”
68751	68770	68748	68748	She	1825	“ If you think I am in love with some one else , you are very much mistaken . ”
68771	68788	68592	68592	She	1821	“ Of course I do n’t think that . You are not that kind , Lucy . ”
68789	68876	68877	68877	He	1827	“ Oh , yes , you do think it . It ’s your old idea , the idea that has kept Europe back — I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men . If a girl breaks off her engagement , everyone says : ‘ Oh , she had someone else in her mind ; she hopes to get someone else . ’ It ’s disgusting , brutal ! As if a girl ca n’t break it off for the sake of freedom . ”
68881	68904	68877	68877	He	1827	“ I may have said that in the past . I shall never say it again . You have taught me better . ”
68918	68978	68905	68905	She	1828	“ Of course , there is no question of ‘ someone else ’ in this , no ‘ jilting ’ or any such nauseous stupidity . I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was . I only meant that there was a force in you that I had n’t known of up till now . ”
68979	69000	68877	68877	He	1827	“ All right , Cecil , that will do . Do n’t apologize to me . It was my mistake . ”
69001	69043	69044	69044	His	1829	“ It is a question between ideals , yours and mine — pure abstract ideals , and yours are the nobler . I was bound up in the old vicious notions , and all the time you were splendid and new . ”
69048	69085	69044	69044	His	1829	“ I must actually thank you for what you have done — for showing me what I really am . Solemnly , I thank you for showing me a true woman . Will you shake hands ? ”
69086	69092	69094	69094	Lucy	115	“ Of course I will , ”
69105	69135	69094	69094	Lucy	115	“ Good - night , Cecil . Good - bye . That ’s all right . I ’m sorry about it . Thank you very much for your gentleness . ”
69136	69146	69147	69147	They	1830	“ Let me light your candle , shall I ? ”
69153	69168	69147	69147	They	1830	“ Thank you . Good - night again . God bless you , Lucy ! ”
69169	69176	69177	69177	She	115	“ Good - bye , Cecil . ”
69721	69724	69747	69748	expensive architects	1865	“ did , ”
69842	69853	69855	69856	Miss Catharine	156	“ Since Florence did my poor sister so much good , ”
69858	69924	69855	69856	Miss Catharine	156	“ we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter . Of course , Athens is a plunge , and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread ; but , after all , we can take that with us , and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train . But is there an English Church ? ”
69933	69964	69965	69965	Lucy	115	“ I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens , but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople , we should be so grateful . ”
70311	70323	70324	70324	he	368	“ So you ’re off for a minute , Mr. Vyse ? ”
70330	70333	70327	70327	Cecil	210	“ Yes , ”
70339	70356	70357	70357	He	210	“ I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch . ”
70362	70401	70402	70402	Cecil	210	“ Is n’t it wonderful ? Is n’t it romance ? Most certainly they will go to Constantinople . They are taken in a snare that can not fail . They will end by going round the world . ”
70419	70520	70408	70408	he	210	“ Is n’t Romance capricious ! I never notice it in you young people ; you do nothing but play lawn tennis , and say that romance is dead , while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing . ‘ A really comfortable pension at Constantinople ! ’ So they call it out of decency , but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn ! No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans . They want the Pension Keats . ”
70521	70532	70534	70534	Freddy	129	“ I ’m awfully sorry to interrupt , Mr. Beebe , ”
70536	70543	70534	70534	Freddy	129	“ but have you any matches ? ”
70544	70548	70550	70550	Cecil	210	“ I have , ”
70570	70585	70562	70562	he	210	“ You have never met these Miss Alans , have you , Mr. Vyse ? ”
70586	70589	70408	70408	he	210	“ Never . ”
70590	70722	70723	70723	He	1891	“ Then you do n’t see the wonder of this Greek visit . I have n’t been to Greece myself , and do n’t mean to go , and I ca n’t imagine any of my friends going . It is altogether too big for our little lot . Do n’t you think so ? Italy is just about as much as we can manage . Italy is heroic , but Greece is godlike or devilish — I am not sure which , and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus . All right , Freddy — I am not being clever , upon my word I am not — I took the idea from another fellow ; and give me those matches when you ’ve done with them . ”
70738	70806	70723	70723	He	1891	“ I was saying , if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background , let it be Italian . Big enough in all conscience . The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me . There the contrast is just as much as I can realize . But not the Parthenon , not the frieze of Phidias at any price ; and here comes the victoria . ”
70807	70813	70815	70815	Cecil	210	“ You ’re quite right , ”
70817	70825	70828	70828	he	1891	“ Greece is not for our little lot ”
70890	70932	70887	70887	he	1891	“ I ’m so glad you only talked about books . Cecil ’s hard hit . Lucy wo n’t marry him . If you ’d gone on about her , as you did about them , he might have broken down . ”
70933	70937	70887	70887	he	1891	“ But when — ”
70938	70947	70887	70887	he	1891	“ Late last night . I must go . ”
70948	70958	70887	70887	he	1891	“ Perhaps they wo n’t want me down there . ”
70959	70969	70887	70887	he	1891	“ No — go on . Good - bye . ”
70970	70974	70979	70979	himself	120	“ Thank goodness ! ”
70990	71008	70986	70986	his	120	“ It was the one foolish thing she ever did . Oh , what a glorious riddance ! ”
71140	71145	71285	71286	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ garden - child , ”
71161	71236	71237	71239	Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Oh , how do you do , Mr. Beebe ? Gracious what a mess everything is ! Look at my scarlet pompoms , and the wind blowing your skirts about , and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in , and then the carriage having to go out , when I had counted on having Powell , who — give everyone their due — does tie up dahlias properly . ”
71243	71249	71251	71252	Miss Bartlett	114	“ How do you do ? ”
71275	71283	71285	71286	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ Here , Lennie , the bass , ”
71343	71351	71352	71352	he	1900	“ Come for a walk with me , ”
71356	71393	71352	71352	he	1900	“ You have worried them as much as they can stand . Mrs. Honeychurch , I only called in aimlessly . I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern , if I may . ”
71394	71434	71435	71436	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Oh , must you ? Yes do.—Not the scissors , thank you , Charlotte , when both my hands are full already — I’m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it . ”
71457	71488	71447	71448	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Yes , Charlotte , I do n’t want you — do go ; there ’s nothing to stop about for , either in the house or out of it . ”
71565	71576	71577	71577	he	120	“ It is terrible , this havoc among the flowers , ”
71580	71596	71598	71599	Miss Bartlett	114	“ It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment , ”
71601	71621	71598	71599	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother . Or will she come with us ? ”
71622	71639	71598	71599	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I think we had better leave Lucy to herself , and to her own pursuits . ”
71640	71654	71656	71656	Minnie	241	“ They ’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast , ”
71658	71693	71656	71656	Minnie	241	“ and Floyd has gone , and Mr. Vyse has gone , and Freddy wo n’t play with me . In fact , Uncle Arthur , the house is notat allwhat it was yesterday . ”
71694	71701	71705	71705	Arthur	307	“ Do n’t be a prig , ”
71707	71715	71716	71716	He	307	“ Go and put on your boots . ”
71741	71766	71735	71735	She	115	“ How do you do ? Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive . Would you come too ? ”
71767	71778	71716	71716	He	307	“ I do n’t think I will , thank you . ”
71779	71792	71793	71793	Lucy	115	“ No , I did n’t suppose you would care to much . ”
71804	71811	71813	71814	Mr. Beebe	120	“ How delicate those Sonatas are ! ”
71836	71840	71831	71831	Lucy	115	“ Miss Honeychurch ! ”
71841	71844	71813	71814	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Yes . ”
71845	71858	71831	71831	Lucy	115	“ I met them on the hill . Your brother told me . ”
71859	71864	71865	71865	She	115	“ Oh he did ? ”
71887	71899	71875	71875	he	120	“ I need n’t say that it will go no further . ”
71900	71911	71913	71913	Lucy	115	“ Mother , Charlotte , Cecil , Freddy , you , ”
71931	71957	71913	71913	Lucy	115	“ If you ’ll let me say so , I am very glad , and I am certain that you have done the right thing . ”
71958	71974	71875	71875	he	120	“ So I hoped other people would think , but they do n’t seem to . ”
71975	71986	71913	71913	Lucy	115	“ I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise . ”
71987	71996	71913	71913	Lucy	115	“ So does mother . Mother minds dreadfully . ”
71997	72005	72007	72008	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I am very sorry for that , ”
72072	72077	72063	72063	she	115	“ And Freddy minds . ”
72078	72110	72063	72063	she	115	“ Still , Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much , did he ? I gathered that he disliked the engagement , and felt it might separate him from you . ”
72111	72117	72118	72118	Minnie	241	“ Boys are so odd . ”
72170	72197	72167	72167	he	120	“ I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan . That was really what brought me over . I thought it might amuse you all . ”
72198	72202	72204	72204	Lucy	115	“ How delightful ! ”
72242	72251	72238	72238	she	115	“ Going abroad ? When do they start ? ”
72252	72259	72238	72238	she	115	“ Next week , I gather . ”
72260	72271	72238	72238	she	115	“ Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back ? ”
72272	72279	72238	72238	she	115	“ No , he did n’t . ”
72280	72291	72238	72238	she	115	“ Because I do hope he wo n’t go gossiping . ”
72323	72344	72313	72313	she	115	“ Oh , do tell me more about the Miss Alans ! How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad ! ”
72345	72365	72366	72366	She	115	“ I want them to start from Venice , and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast ! ”
72370	72382	72313	72313	she	115	“ Oh , delightful ! I wish they ’d take me . ”
72383	72413	72313	72313	she	115	“ Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel ? Perhaps George Emerson is right . He says that ‘ Italy is only an euphuism for Fate . ’ ”
72414	72441	72442	72443	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Oh , not Italy , but Constantinople . I have always longed to go to Constantinople . Constantinople is practically Asia , is n’t it ? ”
72462	72474	72454	72456	the Miss Alans	160	“ with Delphi , perhaps , if the roads are safe . ”
72511	72531	72506	72506	she	115	“ I did n’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends , after Cissie Villa . ”
72532	72558	72498	72498	He	120	“ Oh , that ’s nothing ; I assure you Cissie Villa ’s nothing to me ; I would give anything to go with them . ”
72559	72577	72506	72506	she	115	“ Would your mother spare you again so soon ? You have scarcely been home three months . ”
72578	72582	72584	72584	Lucy	115	“ Shemustspare me ! ”
72590	72599	72600	72600	She	115	“ I simplymustgo away . I have to . ”
72609	72638	72602	72602	her	115	“ Do n’t you see that Ihaveto go away ? I did n’t realize at the time — and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly . ”
72639	72653	72602	72602	her	115	“ You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel — ”
72654	72665	72602	72602	her	115	“ Yes , yes . I knew you ’d understand . ”
72728	72751	72715	72715	He	120	“ Yes , of course ; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down . ”
72752	72763	72764	72764	he	120	“ I am afraid it has been a bothersome business , ”
72768	72864	72764	72764	he	120	“ No , not at all . Cecil was very kind indeed ; only — I had better tell you the whole truth , since you have heard a little — it was that he is so masterful . I found that he would n’t let me go my own way . He would improve me in places where I ca n’t be improved . Cecil wo n’t let a woman decide for herself — in fact , he dare n’t . What nonsense I do talk ! But that is the kind of thing . ”
72865	72924	72715	72715	He	120	“ It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse ; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you . I do sympathize and agree most profoundly . I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism : Is it worth while rushing off to Greece ? ”
72925	72932	72933	72933	she	1914	“ But I must go somewhere ! ”
72936	72952	72953	72953	She	1914	“ I have been worrying all the morning , and here comes the very thing . ”
72964	73005	72953	72953	She	1914	“ I must ! And the time I shall have with mother , and all the money she spent on me last spring . You all think much too highly of me . I wish you were n’t so kind . ”
73018	73041	73009	73010	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I must get away , ever so far . I must know my own mind and where I want to go . ”
73042	73052	73054	73055	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Come along ; tea , tea , tea , ”
73100	73106	73107	73107	he	120	“ She is playing again , ”
73113	73119	73107	73107	he	120	“ Lucy can always play , ”
73125	73181	73107	73107	he	120	“ One is very thankful that she has such a resource . She is evidently much worried , as , of course , she ought to be . I know all about it . The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak . ”
73214	73228	73205	73205	he	120	“ she might yet reveal depths of strangeness , if not of meaning . ”
73268	73278	73262	73262	She	241	“ We had much better let the matter drop . ”
73279	73283	73262	73262	She	241	“ I wonder . ”
73284	73315	73319	73319	his	120	“ It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street . It would bedeathto gossip about Mr. Vyse ’s dismissal at the present moment . ”
73342	73375	73339	73339	He	120	“ Of course , Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way , and when she chooses . Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind . ”
73376	73380	73382	73383	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I know , ”
73386	73404	73382	73383	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you . One can not be too careful . ”
73405	73409	73339	73339	He	120	“ Quite so . ”
73410	73427	73382	73383	Miss Bartlett	114	“ I do implore absolute secrecy . A chance word to a chattering friend , and — ”
73428	73431	73432	73432	He	120	“ Exactly . ”
73492	73573	73486	73487	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately ? I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish . It is odd how we of that pension , who seemed such a fortuitous collection , have been working into one another ’s lives . Two , three , four , six of us — no , eight ; I had forgotten the Emersons — have kept more or less in touch . We must really give the Signora a testimonial . ”
73755	73781	73752	73752	he	120	“ We sha n’t have rain , but we shall have darkness , so let us hurry on . The darkness last night was appalling . ”
73888	73897	73898	73898	he	120	“ I have been thinking , Miss Bartlett , ”
73901	73918	73898	73898	he	120	“ and , unless you very much object , I would like to reopen that discussion . ”
73922	73989	73990	73990	He	120	“ Nothing about the past . I know little and care less about that ; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin ’s credit . She has acted loftily and rightly , and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her . But the future . Seriously , what do you think of this Greek plan ? ”
73997	74032	73990	73990	He	120	“ I do n’t know whether you overheard , but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career . It ’s all — I ca n’t explain — it ’s wrong . ”
74055	74066	74071	74071	she	114	“ I ca n’t see the point of it myself . ”
74074	74091	74071	74071	she	114	“ There I can not agree with you . In it I spy Lucy ’s salvation . ”
74092	74099	73990	73990	He	120	“ Really . Now , why ? ”
74100	74108	73990	73990	He	120	“ She wanted to leave Windy Corner . ”
74109	74133	74071	74071	she	114	“ I know — but it seems so odd , so unlike her , so — I was going to say — selfish . ”
74134	74153	73990	73990	He	120	“ It is natural , surely — after such painful scenes — that she should desire a change . ”
74173	74227	74169	74170	Mr. Beebe	120	“ So she says herself , and since another lady agrees with her , I must own that I am partially convinced . Perhaps she must have a change . I have no sisters or — and I do n’t understand these things . But why need she go as far as Greece ? ”
74228	74235	74237	74238	Miss Bartlett	114	“ You may well ask that , ”
74253	74335	74237	74238	Miss Bartlett	114	“ Why Greece ? ( What is it , Minnie dear — jam ? ) Why not Tunbridge Wells ? Oh , Mr. Beebe ! I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning . I can not help her . I will say no more . Perhaps I have already said too much . I am not to talk . I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells , and she refused . ”
74346	74408	74343	74343	his	120	“ But my feelings are of no importance . I know too well that I get on Lucy ’s nerves . Our tour was a failure . She wanted to leave Florence , and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome , and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother ’s money—. ”
74409	74419	74421	74422	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Let us keep to the future , though , ”
74424	74430	74421	74422	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I want your advice . ”
74431	74435	74437	74437	Charlotte	185	“ Very well , ”
74454	74469	74470	74471	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I for one will help her to go to Greece . Will you ? ”
74474	74480	74481	74481	she	185	“ It is absolutely necessary , ”
74502	74508	74481	74481	she	185	“ I know — Iknow . ”
74526	74584	74519	74521	this odd woman	1931	“ She must not stop here a moment , and we must keep quiet till she goes . I trust that the servants know nothing . Afterwards — but I may have said too much already . Only , Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone . If you help we may succeed . Otherwise — ”
74585	74589	74613	74614	the clergyman	368	“ Otherwise — ? ”
74590	74593	74594	74594	she	185	“ Otherwise , ”
74603	74611	74613	74614	the clergyman	368	“ Yes , I will help her , ”
74621	74637	74613	74614	the clergyman	368	“ Come , let us go back now , and settle the whole thing up . ”
74693	74696	74662	74662	she	114	“ another man ”
74775	74789	74746	74746	His	120	“ They that marry do well , but they that refrain do better . ”
74988	74994	74995	74995	she	163	“ It gets too dark , ”
74999	75037	74995	74995	she	163	“ This comes of putting off . We might have known the weather would break up soon ; and now Lucy wants to go to Greece . I do n’t know what the world ’s coming to . ”
75038	75042	75043	75043	he	129	“ Mrs. Honeychurch , ”
75046	75079	75043	75043	he	129	“ go to Greece she must . Come up to the house and let ’s talk it over . Do you , in the first place , mind her breaking with Vyse ? ”
75080	75091	74995	74995	she	163	“ Mr. Beebe , I ’m thankful — simply thankful . ”
75092	75097	75099	75099	Freddy	129	“ So am I , ”
75101	75111	75099	75099	Freddy	129	“ Good . Now come up to the house . ”
75198	75208	75209	75209	she	163	“ I do n’t see why Greece is necessary , ”
75212	75243	75209	75209	she	163	“ but as you do , I suppose it is all right . It must be something I ca n’t understand . Lucy ! Let ’s tell her . Lucy ! ”
75244	75251	75252	75253	Mr. Beebe	120	“ She is playing the piano , ”
75269	75278	75256	75256	He	120	“ Look not thou on beauty ’s charming . ”
75279	75291	75209	75209	she	163	“ I did n’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang , too . ”
75292	75311	75209	75209	she	163	“ Sit thou still when kings are arming , Taste not when the wine - cup glistens — — ”
75312	75327	75209	75209	she	163	“ It ’s a song that Cecil gave her . How odd girls are ! ”
75328	75333	75335	75335	Lucy	115	“ What ’s that ? ”
75340	75346	75348	75349	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ All right , dear , ”
75370	75391	75364	75364	her	163	“ I am sorry I was so cross about Greece , but it came on the top of the dahlias . ”
75398	75411	75392	75395	Rather a hard voice	1952	“ Thank you , mother ; that does n’t matter a bit . ”
75412	75437	75392	75395	Rather a hard voice	1952	“ And you are right , too — Greece will be all right ; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you . ”
75438	75448	75449	75450	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Oh , splendid ! Oh , thank you ! ”
75591	75608	75609	75609	she	484	“ Taste not when the wine - cup glistens , Speak not when the people listens , ”
75612	75618	75609	75609	she	484	“ Here ’s Mr. Beebe . ”
75619	75627	75609	75609	she	484	“ Mr. Beebe knows my rude ways . ”
75628	75639	75641	75641	he	120	“ It ’s a beautiful song and a wise one , ”
75643	75647	75609	75609	she	484	“ Go on . ”
75648	75655	75656	75656	she	484	“ It is n’t very good , ”
75660	75669	75656	75656	she	484	“ I forget why — harmony or something . ”
75670	75682	75609	75609	she	484	“ I suspected it was unscholarly . It ’s so beautiful . ”
75683	75690	75692	75692	Freddy	129	“ The tune ’s right enough , ”
75694	75707	75692	75692	Freddy	129	“ but the words are rotten . Why throw up the sponge ? ”
75708	75714	75716	75717	his sister	892	“ How stupidly you talk ! ”
75773	75783	75752	75752	Freddy	129	“ This has been a day and a half . ”
75784	75792	75765	75765	his	129	“ Stop thine ear against the singer — ”
75793	75802	75765	75765	his	129	“ Wait a minute ; she is finishing . ”
75803	75821	75765	75765	his	129	“ From the red gold keep thy finger;Vacant heart and hand and eyeEasy live and quiet die . ”
75822	75829	75831	75831	Freddy	129	“ I love weather like this , ”
75897	75905	75890	75890	she	115	“ Vacant heart and hand and eye — ”
75910	75914	75890	75890	she	115	“ the better part ”
75954	75966	75890	75890	she	115	“ Vacant heart and hand and eyeEasy live and quiet die . ”
76138	76169	76131	76131	Lucy	115	“ But , of course , you know all about these things , and you have Mr. Vyse to help you . A gentleman is such a stand - by . ”
76193	76206	76207	76208	Miss Catharine	156	“ We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you , ”
76211	76236	76207	76208	Miss Catharine	156	“ It is not every young man who would be so unselfish . But perhaps he will come out and join you later on . ”
76237	76247	76249	76250	Miss Teresa	155	“ Or does his work keep him in London ? ”
76263	76284	76249	76250	Miss Teresa	155	“ However , we shall see him when he sees you off . I do so long to see him . ”
76285	76293	76295	76296	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ No one will see Lucy off , ”
76298	76305	76295	76296	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ She does n’t like it . ”
76306	76315	76317	76317	Lucy	115	“ No , I hate seeings - off , ”
76319	76334	76317	76317	Lucy	115	“ Really ? How funny ! I should have thought that in this case — ”
76335	76356	76357	76357	They	1974	“ Oh , Mrs. Honeychurch , you are n’t going ? It is such a pleasure to have met you ! ”
76366	76379	76361	76361	Lucy	115	“ That ’s all right . We just got through that time . ”
76386	76450	76451	76451	Lucy	115	“ I should be told , dear , that I am unsympathetic . But I can not see why you did n’t tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it . There all the time we had to sit fencing , and almost telling lies , and be seen through , too , I dare say , which is most unpleasant . ”
76487	76499	76459	76459	She	115	“ But why should n’t it be everywhere in no time ? ”
76500	76537	76459	76459	She	115	“ Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England . I shall tell them then . It ’s much pleasanter . How wet it is ! Let ’s turn in here . ”
76538	76540	76459	76459	She	115	“ Here ”
76600	76627	76587	76588	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Oh , well , let it be shop , then . Let ’s go to Mudie ’s . I ’ll buy a guide - book . ”
76628	76710	76568	76568	she	115	“ You know , Lucy , you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I ’m so stupid , so I suppose I am , but I shall never understand this hole - and - corner work . You ’ve got rid of Cecil — well and good , and I ’m thankful he ’s gone , though I did feel angry for the minute . But why not announce it ? Why this hushing up and tip - toeing ? ”
76711	76720	76587	76588	Mr. Beebe	120	“ It ’s only for a few days . ”
76721	76727	76728	76728	Lucy	115	“ But why at all ? ”
76747	76767	76587	76588	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Because George Emerson has been bothering me , and if he hears I ’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite
76837	76876	76833	76833	She	163	“ My daughter wo n’t answer me ; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me . Any rag , tag , and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home . ”
76893	76901	76888	76888	she	163	“ You ’re tired of Windy Corner . ”
76989	77048	76985	76985	She	115	“ I do not love George ; I broke off my engagement because I did not love George ; I must go to Greece because I do not love George ; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother ; everyone else is behaving very badly . ”
77078	77098	77072	77072	she	115	“ Oh , mother , what rubbish you talk ! Of course I ’m not tired of Windy Corner . ”
77099	77115	77116	77116	She	115	“ Then why not say so at once , instead of considering half an hour ? ”
77120	77126	77116	77116	She	115	“ Half aminutewould be nearer . ”
77127	77140	77072	77072	she	115	“ Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether ? ”
77141	77150	77072	77072	she	115	“ Hush , mother ! People will hear you ”
77167	77217	77159	77159	She	115	“ Of course I want to live at home ; but as we are talking about it , I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been . You see , I come into my money next year . ”
77238	77241	77242	77242	Lucy	115	“ eccentricity , ”
77250	77312	77242	77242	Lucy	115	“ I ’ve seen the world so little — I felt so out of things in Italy . I have seen so little of life ; one ought to come up to London more — not a cheap ticket like to - day , but to stop . I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl . ”
77313	77323	77325	77326	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ And mess with typewriters and latch - keys , ”
77328	77408	77325	77326	Mrs. Honeychurch	163	“ And agitate and scream , and be carried off kicking by the police . And call it a Mission — when no one wants you ! And call it Duty — when it means that you ca n’t stand your own home ! And call it Work — when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is ! And then to prepare yourself , find two doddering old ladies , and go abroad with them . ”
77409	77415	77417	77417	Lucy	115	“ I want more independence , ”
77481	77542	77543	77543	Lucy	115	“ Very well . Take your independence and be gone . Rush up and down and round the world , and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food . Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted , and our dear view — and then share a flat with another girl . ”
77551	77557	77543	77543	Lucy	115	“ Perhaps I spoke hastily . ”
77558	77563	77564	77565	her mother	484	“ Oh , goodness ! ”
77568	77578	77564	77565	her mother	484	“ How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett ! ”
77579	77582	77586	77586	her	115	“ Charlotte ? ”
77597	77602	77586	77586	her	115	“ More every moment . ”
77603	77624	77564	77565	her mother	484	“ I do n’t know what you mean , mother ; Charlotte and I are not the very least alike . ”
77625	77662	77564	77565	her mother	484	“ Well , I see the likeness . The same eternal worrying , the same taking back of words . You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters . ”
77663	77709	77586	77586	her	115	“ What rubbish ! And if you dislike Charlotte so , it ’s rather a pity you asked her to stop . I warned you about her ; I begged you , implored you not to , but of course it was not listened to . ”
77710	77715	77564	77565	her mother	484	“ There you go . ”
77716	77722	77564	77565	her mother	484	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
77723	77738	77739	77739	Lucy	115	“ Charlotte again , my dear ; that ’s all ; her very words . ”
77744	77768	77739	77739	Lucy	115	“ My point is that you ought n’t to have asked Charlotte to stop . I wish you would keep to the point . ”
77878	77889	77890	77890	she	115	“ The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable , ”
77927	77956	77921	77922	Mr. Beebe	120	“ We shall have to sit three a side , because the trees drop , and yet it is n’t raining . Oh , for a little air ! ”

77984	77991	77992	77992	she	115	“ Can’twe have the hood down ? ”
78005	78016	77992	77992	she	115	“ Very well , old lady , stop the horse . ”
78082	78092	78093	78093	she	115	“ Is that house to let again , Powell ? ”
78096	78101	78102	78102	he	305	“ Yes , miss , ”
78105	78110	78102	78102	he	305	“ Have they gone ? ”
78111	78149	78172	78172	Lucy	115	“ It is too far out of town for the young gentleman , and his father ’s rheumatism has come on , so he ca n’t stop on alone , so they are trying to let furnished , ”
78154	78161	78172	78172	Lucy	115	“ They have gone , then ? ”
78162	78171	78172	78172	Lucy	115	“ Yes , miss , they have gone . ”
78335	78338	78340	78341	the hostess	2006	“ Certainly , ”
78344	78364	78340	78341	the hostess	2006	“ I forgot it was Friday . Let ’s all go . Powell can go round to the stables . ”
78365	78369	78340	78341	the hostess	2006	“ Lucy dearest — ”
78370	78379	78340	78341	the hostess	2006	“ No church for me , thank you . ”
78536	78544	78524	78525	Some one	2339	“ A lady to wait , sir . ”
78563	78574	78575	78575	he	289	“ Oh , Miss Honeychurch , that you should come ! ”
78619	78676	78598	78598	George	119	“ Miss Honeychurch , dear , we are so sorry ! George is so sorry ! He thought he had a right to try . I can not blame my boy , and yet I wish he had told me first . He ought not to have tried . I knew nothing about it at all . ”
78692	78700	78686	78686	He	383	“ But you must not scold him . ”
78716	78721	78722	78722	he	383	“ I taught him , ”
78725	78777	78722	78722	he	383	“ to trust in love . I said : ‘ When love comes , that is reality . ’ I said : ‘ Passion does not blind . No . Passion is sanity , and the woman you love , she is the only person you will ever really understand . ’ ”
78781	78831	78778	78778	He	383	“ True , everlastingly true , though my day is over , and though there is the result . Poor boy ! He is so sorry ! He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in ; that whatever you felt you did not mean . Yet”—his
78841	78849	78836	78836	he	383	certain—“Miss Honeychurch , do you remember Italy ? ”
78872	78888	78869	78869	she	115	“ I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son . ”
78889	78896	78869	78869	she	115	“ But you do remember it ? ”
78897	78906	78869	78869	she	115	“ He has misbehaved himself from the first . ”
78907	78933	78869	78869	she	115	“ I only was told that he loved you last Sunday . I never could judge behaviour . I — I — suppose he has . ”
78974	78982	78983	78983	she	115	“ Why , he has behaved abominably , ”
78986	79001	78983	78983	she	115	“ I am glad he is sorry . Do you know what he did ? ”
79002	79008	78983	78983	she	115	“ Not ‘ abominably , ’ ”
79014	79057	78983	78983	she	115	“ He only tried when he should not have tried . You have all you want , Miss Honeychurch : you are going to marry the man you love . Do not go out of George ’s life saying he is abominable . ”
79058	79064	79066	79066	Lucy	115	“ No , of course , ”
79075	79121	79066	79066	Lucy	115	“ ‘ Abominable ’ is much too strong . I am sorry I used it about your son . I think I will go to church , after all . My mother and my cousin have gone . I shall not be so very late — ”
79122	79130	79131	79131	he	210	“ Especially as he has gone under , ”
79135	79140	79131	79131	he	210	“ What was that ? ”
79141	79146	79147	79147	He	210	“ Gone under naturally . ”
79162	79168	79147	79147	He	210	“ I do n’t understand . ”
79169	79175	79131	79131	he	210	“ As his mother did . ”
79176	79191	79131	79131	he	210	“ But , Mr. Emerson — Mr. Emerson — what are you talking about ? ”
79192	79201	79203	79203	he	210	“ When I would n’t have George baptized , ”
79209	79238	79239	79239	He	210	“ And she agreed that baptism was nothing , but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round . She thought it a judgement . ”
79242	79340	79239	79239	He	210	“ Oh , horrible , when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents . Oh , horrible — worst of all — worse than death , when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness , planted your little garden , let in your sunlight , and then the weeds creep in again ! A judgement ! And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church ! Is it possible , Miss Honeychurch ? Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever ? ”
79341	79347	79349	79349	Lucy	115	“ I do n’t know , ”
79351	79369	79349	79349	Lucy	115	“ I do n’t understand this sort of thing . I was not meant to understand it . ”
79370	79424	79239	79239	He	210	“ But Mr. Eager — he came when I was out , and acted according to his principles . I do n’t blame him or any one ... but by the time George was well she was ill . He made her think about sin , and she went under thinking about it . ”
79441	79447	79449	79449	Lucy	115	“ Oh , how terrible ! ”
79458	79464	79466	79468	the old man	346	“ He was not baptized , ”
79470	79476	79466	79468	the old man	346	“ I did hold firm . ”
79502	79513	79514	79514	She	115	“ My boy shall go back to the earth untouched . ”
79523	79529	79530	79530	He	346	“ Oh — last Sunday . ”
79536	79627	79530	79530	He	346	“ George last Sunday — no , not ill : just gone under . He is never ill . But he is his mother ’s son . Her eyes were his , and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful , and he will not think it worth while to live . It was always touch and go . He will live ; but he will not think it worth while to live . He will never think anything worth while . You remember that church at Florence ? ”
79644	79676	79634	79634	she	115	“ After you left Florence — horrible . Then we took the house here , and he goes bathing with your brother , and became better . You saw him bathing ? ”
79677	79699	79634	79634	she	115	“ I am so sorry , but it is no good discussing this affair . I am deeply sorry about it . ”
79700	79778	79634	79634	she	115	“ Then there came something about a novel . I did n’t follow it at all ; I had to hear so much , and he minded telling me ; he finds me too old . Ah , well , one must have failures . George comes down to - morrow , and takes me up to his London rooms . He ca n’t bear to be about here , and I must be where he is . ”
79779	79783	79785	79786	the girl	369	“ Mr. Emerson , ”
79788	79813	79785	79786	the girl	369	“ do n’t leave at least , not on my account . I am going to Greece . Do n’t leave your comfortable house . ”
79828	79861	79825	79825	he	2025	“ How good everyone is ! And look at Mr. Beebe housing me — came over this morning and heard I was going ! Here I am so comfortable with a fire . ”
79862	79878	79634	79634	she	115	“ Yes , but you wo n’t go back to London . It ’s absurd . ”
79879	79928	79825	79825	he	2025	“ I must be with George ; I must make him care to live , and down here he ca n’t . He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you — I am not justifying him : I am only saying what has happened . ”
79929	79933	79634	79634	she	115	“ Oh , Mr. Emerson”—she
79938	79991	79825	79825	he	2025	hand—“you must n’t . I ’ve been bother enough to the world by now . I ca n’t have you moving out of your house when you like it , and perhaps losing money through it — all on my account . You must stop ! I am just going to Greece . ”
79992	79999	80000	80000	Her	2027	“ All the way to Greece ? ”
80004	80008	80000	80000	Her	2027	“ To Greece ? ”
80009	80032	79825	79825	he	2025	“ So you must stop . You wo n’t talk about this business , I know . I can trust you both . ”
80033	80057	79825	79825	he	2025	“ Certainly you can . We either have you in our lives , or leave you to the life that you have chosen . ”
80058	80064	80000	80000	Her	2027	“ I should n’t want — ”
80065	80101	80102	80102	She	2028	“ I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George ? No , it was wrong of George to try . We have pushed our beliefs too far . I fancy that we deserve sorrow . ”
80210	80226	80204	80204	he	120	“ No , please sit still . I think I will sit in the carriage . ”
80227	80236	80204	80204	he	120	“ Miss Honeychurch , you do sound tired . ”
80237	80242	80244	80244	Lucy	115	“ Not a bit , ”
80250	80274	80244	80244	Lucy	115	“ But you are , and there ’s a look of George about you . And what were you saying about going abroad ? ”
80279	80280	80281	80281	she	2034	“ Greece”—and
80289	80303	80284	80284	he	120	over—“Greece ; but you were to be married this year , I thought . ”
80304	80313	80315	80315	Lucy	115	“ Not till January , it was n’t , ”
80334	80360	80322	80322	she	115	“ I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you . I hope — it is n’t because George spoke that you are both going ? ”
80361	80364	80284	80284	he	120	“ No . ”
80365	80377	80284	80284	he	120	“ I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse . ”
80378	80382	80284	80284	he	120	“ Thank you . ”
80400	80406	80407	80407	he	120	“ That ’s all right , ”
80411	80461	80407	80407	he	120	“ I counted on you two keeping each other company . It ’s pouring again . The entire congregation , which consists of your cousin , your mother , and my mother , stands waiting in the church , till the carriage fetches it . Did Powell go round ? ”
80462	80471	80284	80284	he	120	“ I think so ; I ’ll see . ”
80472	80488	80284	80284	he	120	“ No — of course , I ’ll see . How are the Miss Alans ? ”
80489	80496	80407	80407	he	120	“ Very well , thank you . ”
80497	80506	80284	80284	he	120	“ Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece ? ”
80507	80513	80284	80284	he	120	“ I — I did . ”
80514	80558	80407	80407	he	120	“ Do n’t you think it very plucky of her , Mr. Emerson , to undertake the two Miss Alans ? Now , Miss Honeychurch , go back — keep warm . I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling . ”
80567	80573	80574	80574	she	2038	“ He is not going , ”
80578	80592	80574	80574	she	2038	“ I made a slip . Mr. Vyse does stop behind in England . ”
80732	80746	80724	80724	he	2039	“ You are leaving him ? You are leaving the man you love ? ”
80747	80754	80724	80724	he	2039	“ I — I had to . ”
80755	80763	80774	80774	She	2038	“ Why , Miss Honeychurch , why ? ”
80816	80829	80808	80808	her	2038	“ My dear , I am worried about you . It seems to me”—dreamily
80834	80841	80831	80831	she	2038	alarmed—“that you are in a muddle . ”
80847	81002	80844	80844	her	2038	“ Take an old man ’s word ; there ’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world . It is easy to face Death and Fate , and the things that sound so dreadful . It is on my muddles that I look back with horror — on the things that I might have avoided . We can help one another but little . I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life , but I know better now , and all my teaching of George has come down to this : beware of muddle . Do you remember in that church , when you pretended to be annoyed with me and were n’t ? Do you remember before , when you refused the room with the view ? Those were muddles — little , but ominous — and I am fearing that you are in one now . ”
81007	81026	81003	81003	She	2045	“ Do n’t trust me , Miss Honeychurch . Though life is very glorious , it is difficult . ”
81032	81092	81027	81027	She	2045	“ ‘ Life ’ wrote a friend of mine , ‘ is a public performance on the violin , in which you must learn the instrument as you go along . ’ I think he puts it well . Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along — especially the function of Love . ”
81099	81114	81094	81094	he	2046	“ That ’s it ; that ’s what I mean . You love George ! ”
81134	81139	81140	81140	he	2046	“ But you do , ”
81149	81185	81140	81140	he	2046	“ You love the boy body and soul , plainly , directly , as he loves you , and no other word expresses it . You wo n’t marry the other man for his sake . ”
81186	81191	81193	81193	Lucy	115	“ How dare you ! ”
81204	81225	81193	81193	Lucy	115	“ Oh , how like a man!—I mean , to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man . ”
81226	81231	81232	81232	She	115	“ But you are . ”
81237	81421	81232	81232	She	115	“ You ’re shocked , but I mean to shock you . It ’s the only hope at times . I can reach you no other way . You must marry , or your life will be wasted . You have gone too far to retreat . I have no time for the tenderness , and the comradeship , and the poetry , and the things that really matter , andfor whichyou marry . I know that , with George , you will find them , and that you love him . Then be his wife . He is already part of you . Though you fly to Greece , and never see him again , or forget his very name , George will work in your thoughts till you die . It is n’t possible to love and to part . You will wish that it was . You can transmute love , ignore it , muddle it , but you can never pull it out of you . I know by experience that the poets are right : love is eternal . ”
81441	81564	81566	81566	he	2048	“ I only wish poets would say this , too : love is of the body ; not the body , but of the body . Ah ! the misery that would be saved if we confessed that ! Ah ! for a little directness to liberate the soul ! Your soul , dear Lucy ! I hate the word now , because of all the ca nt with which superstition has wrapped it round . But we have souls . I can not say how they came nor whither they go , but we have them , and I see you ruining yours . I can not bear it . It is again the darkness creeping in ; it is hell . ”
81570	81632	81566	81566	he	2048	“ What nonsense I have talked — how abstract and remote ! And I have made you cry ! Dear girl , forgive my prosiness ; marry my boy . When I think what life is , and how seldom love is answered by love — Marry him ; it is one of the moments for which the world was made . ”
81668	81673	81659	81659	she	2049	“ Then , Lucy — ”
81674	81680	81681	81681	she	2049	“ You ’ve frightened me , ”
81684	81697	81681	81681	she	2049	“ Cecil — Mr. Beebe — the ticket ’s bought — everything . ”
81705	81739	81698	81698	She	2049	“ I ’m caught in the tangle . I must suffer and grow old away from him . I can not break the whole of life for his sake . They trusted me . ”
81750	81765	81767	81767	she	2049	“ Give George my love — once only . Tell him ‘ muddle . ’ ”
81781	81784	81767	81767	she	2049	“ Lucy — ”
81785	81806	81767	81767	she	2049	“ No — they are in the hall — oh , please not , Mr. Emerson — they trust me — ”
81807	81819	81820	81821	Mr. Beebe	120	“ But why should they , when you have deceived them ? ”
81828	81834	81820	81821	Mr. Beebe	120	“ Here ’s my mother . ”
81835	81844	81820	81821	Mr. Beebe	120	“ You ’re not worthy of their trust . ”
81845	81850	81852	81853	Mr. Beebe	120	“ What ’s that ? ”
81856	81871	81852	81853	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I was saying , why should you trust her when she deceived you ? ”
81872	81878	81879	81879	He	120	“ One minute , mother . ”
81887	81906	81879	81879	He	120	“ I do n’t follow you , Mr. Emerson . To whom do you refer ? Trust whom ? ”
81907	81930	81931	81932	Mr. Beebe	120	“ I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George . They have loved one another all along . ”
81970	81977	81979	81979	Lucy	115	“ I shall never marry him , ”
81993	81997	81990	81990	he	120	“ Why not ? ”
81998	82012	82052	82052	his	120	“ Mr. Beebe — I have misled you — I have misled myself — ”
82013	82021	81990	81990	he	120	“ Oh , rubbish , Miss Honeychurch ! ”
82022	82028	82030	82032	the old man	346	“ It is not rubbish ! ”
82035	82048	82030	82032	the old man	346	“ It ’s the part of people that you do n’t understand . ”
82062	82067	82030	82032	the old man	346	“ Lucy ! Lucy ! ”
82074	82083	82084	82084	He	120	“ Mr. Beebe , could you help me ? ”
82100	82119	82084	82084	He	120	“ I am more grieved than I can possibly express . It is lamentable , lamentable — incredible . ”
82120	82128	82131	82132	the other	2542	“ What ’s wrong with the boy ? ”
82135	82160	82161	82161	He	120	“ Nothing , Mr. Emerson , except that he no longer interests me . Marry George , Miss Honeychurch . He will do admirably . ”
82178	82181	82168	82168	They	2056	“ Lucy ! ”
82210	82330	82195	82195	his	120	“ Now it is all dark . Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed . I know . But remember the mountains over Florence and the view . Ah , dear , if I were George , and gave you one kiss , it would make you brave . You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth , out into the muddle that you have made yourself ; and your mother and all your friends will despise you , oh , my darling , and rightly , if it is ever right to despise . George still dark , all the tussle and the misery without a word from him . Am I justified ? ”
82338	82362	82195	82195	his	120	“ Yes , for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure ; there is Truth . Truth counts , Truth does count . ”
82363	82368	82370	82371	the girl	369	“ You kiss me , ”
82373	82382	82370	82371	the girl	369	“ You kiss me . I will try . ”
82457	82462	82463	82463	she	369	“ never exactly understood , ”
82470	82494	82463	82463	she	369	“ how he managed to strengthen her . It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once . ”
82628	82635	82637	82637	Lucy	115	“ No , it is n’t , ”
82639	82668	82669	82669	He	119	“ because it is the room I had , and I had your father ’s room . I forget why ; Charlotte made me , for some reason . ”
82684	82693	82669	82669	He	119	“ George , you baby , get up . ”
82694	82703	82705	82705	George	119	“ Why should n’t I be a baby ? ”
82741	82747	82748	82748	she	115	“ Oh , bother Charlotte , ”
82752	82761	82748	82748	she	115	“ What can such people be made of ? ”
82762	82771	82748	82748	she	115	“ Same stuff as parsons are made of . ”
82772	82775	82748	82748	she	115	“ Nonsense ! ”
82776	82784	82748	82748	she	115	“ Quite right . It is nonsense . ”
82785	82812	82748	82748	she	115	“ Now you get up off the cold floor , or you ’ll be starting rheumatism next , and you stop laughing and being so silly . ”
82813	82820	82821	82821	he	119	“ Why should n’t I laugh ? ”
82837	82849	82850	82850	He	119	“ What ’s there to cry at ? Kiss me here . ”
82916	82920	82921	82921	he	119	“ Any letters ? ”
82924	82931	82921	82921	he	119	“ Just a line from Freddy . ”
82932	82941	82949	82949	he	119	“ Now kiss me here ; then here . ”
83093	83116	83139	83140	the cabman	2090	“ Lucy , you come and look at the cypresses ; and the church , whatever its name is , still shows . ”
83117	83128	83139	83140	the cabman	2090	“ San Miniato . I ’ll just finish your sock . ”
83129	83137	83139	83140	the cabman	2090	“ Signorino , domani faremo uno giro , ”
83204	83212	83191	83191	George	119	“ Anything good in Freddy ’s letter ? ”
83213	83217	83218	83218	His	119	“ Not yet . ”
83254	83260	83244	83244	she	2093	“ What does he say ? ”
83261	83324	83236	83236	they	2091	“ Silly boy ! He thinks he ’s being dignified . He knew we should go off in the spring — he has known it for six months — that if mother would n’t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands . They had fair warning , and now he calls it an elopement . Ridiculous boy — ”
83325	83333	83244	83244	she	2093	“ Signorino , domani faremo uno giro — ”
83334	83407	83244	83244	she	2093	“ But it will all come right in the end . He has to build us both up from the beginning again . I wish , though , that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women . He has , for the second time , quite altered . Why will men have theories about women ? I have n’t any about men . I wish , too , that Mr. Beebe — ”
83408	83415	83236	83236	they	2091	“ You may well wish that . ”
83416	83479	83244	83244	she	2093	“ He will never forgive us — I mean , he will never be interested in us again . I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner . I wish he hadn’t — But if we act the truth , the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run . ”
83480	83483	83485	83485	he	2094	“ Perhaps . ”
83490	83517	83518	83518	He	2094	“ Well , I acted the truth — the only thing I did do — and you came back to me . So possibly you know . ”
83525	83531	83532	83532	He	2094	“ Nonsense with that sock . ”
83605	83611	83601	83601	They	2097	“ Signorino , domani faremo — ”
83612	83619	83621	83621	Lucy	115	“ Oh , bother that man ! ”
83630	83640	83621	83621	Lucy	115	“ No , do n’t be rude to him . ”
83652	83673	83649	83649	she	115	“ Mr. Eager and Charlotte , dreadful frozen Charlotte . How cruel she would be to a man like that ! ”
83674	83684	83601	83601	They	2097	“ Look at the lights going over the bridge . ”
83685	83759	83601	83601	They	2097	“ But this room reminds me of Charlotte . How horrible to grow old in Charlotte ’s way ! To think that evening at the rectory that she should n’t have heard your father was in the house . For she would have stopped me going in , and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense . You could n’t have made me . When I am very happy”—she
83761	83799	83601	83601	They	2097	him—“I remember on how little it all hangs . If Charlotte had only known , she would have stopped me going in , and I should have gone to silly Greece , and become different for ever . ”
83800	83806	83808	83808	George	119	“ But she did know , ”
83810	83823	83808	83808	George	119	“ she did see my father , surely . He said so . ”
83824	83860	83861	83861	George	119	“ Oh , no , she did n’t see him . She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe , do n’t you remember , and then went straight to the church . She said so . ”
83866	83870	83872	83872	he	119	“ My father , ”
83874	83929	83872	83872	he	119	“ saw her , and I prefer his word . He was dozing by the study fire , and he opened his eyes , and there was Miss Bartlett . A few minutes before you came in . She was turning to go as he woke up . He did n’t speak to her . ”
83993	84023	83984	83984	George	119	“ It ’s clear that she knew . Then , why did she risk the meeting ? She knew he was there , and yet she went to church . ”
84052	84069	84045	84045	She	115	“ How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment . ”
84102	84109	84099	84099	George	119	“ Or did she mean it ? ”
84110	84114	84099	84099	George	119	“ Mean what ? ”
84115	84123	84124	84124	Lucy	115	“ Signorino , domani faremo uno giro — ”
84132	84142	84124	84124	Lucy	115	“ Lascia , prego , lascia . Siamo sposati . ”
84143	84149	84150	84150	he	119	“ Scusi tanto , signora , ”
84162	84169	84150	84150	he	119	“ Buona sera — e grazie . ”
84170	84173	84174	84175	The cabman	2090	“ Niente . ”
84180	84186	84187	84187	He	119	“ Mean what , George ? ”
84190	84407	84187	84187	He	119	“ Is it this ? Is this possible ? I ’ll put a marvel to you . That your cousin has always hoped . That from the very first moment we met , she hoped , far down in her mind , that we should be like this — of course , very far down . That she fought us on the surface , and yet she hoped . I ca n’t explain her any other way . Can you ? Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer ; how she gave you no peace ; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable . The sight of us haunted her — or she could n’t have described us as she did to her friend . There are details — it burnt . I read the book afterwards . She is not frozen , Lucy , she is not withered up all through . She tore us apart twice , but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy . We can never make friends with her or thank her . But I do believe that , far down in her heart , far below all speech and behaviour , she is glad . ”
84408	84413	84415	84415	Lucy	115	“ It is impossible , ”
84431	84439	84428	84428	she	115	“ No — it is just possible . ”
