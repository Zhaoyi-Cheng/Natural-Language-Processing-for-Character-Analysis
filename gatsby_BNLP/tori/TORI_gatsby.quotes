5218	5225	5227	5227	Daisy	155	“ It could n’t be helped ! ”
5249	5293	5232	5232	She	155	“ I looked outdoors for a minute , and it ’s very romantic outdoors . There ’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line . He ’s singing away — ”
5298	5309	5294	5294	Her	155	“ It ’s romantic , is n’t it , Tom ? ”
5310	5314	5315	5315	he	156	“ Very romantic , ”
5324	5343	5315	5315	he	156	“ If it ’s light enough after dinner , I want to take you down to the stables . ”
5615	5627	5628	5628	she	155	“ We do n’t know each other very well , Nick , ”
5632	5647	5628	5628	she	155	“ Even if we are cousins . You did n’t come to my wedding . ”
5648	5657	5699	5699	she	155	“ I was n’t back from the war . ”
5658	5663	5664	5664	She	155	“ That ’s true . ”
5667	5688	5690	5690	she	155	“ Well , I ’ve had a very bad time , Nick , and I ’m pretty cynical about everything . ”
5721	5734	5710	5710	I	0	“ I suppose she talks , and — eats , and everything . ”
5735	5740	5741	5741	She	155	“ Oh , yes . ”

5771	5775	5710	5710	I	0	“ Very much . ”
5776	5898	5741	5741	She	155	“ It ’ll show you how I ’ve gotten to feel about — things . Well , she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where . I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling , and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl . She told me it was a girl , and so I turned my head away and wept . ‘ All right , ’ I said , ‘ I ’m glad it ’s a girl . And I hope she ’ll be a fool — that ’s the best thing a girl can be in this world , a beautiful little fool . ’ “
5908	5917	5901	5901	I	0	” she went on in a convinced way . “
5941	5964	5930	5930	I	0	” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way , rather like Tom ’s , and she laughed with thrilling scorn . “
5973	6169	5930	5930	I	0	” The instant her voice broke off , ceasing to compel my attention , my belief , I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said . It made me uneasy , as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me . I waited , and sure enough , in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face , as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged . Inside , the crimson room bloomed with light . Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from theSaturday Evening Post — the words , murmurous and uninflected , running together in a soothing tune . The lamplight , bright on his boots and dull on the autumn - leaf yellow of her hair , glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms . When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand . “
6174	6185	5930	5930	I	0	” she said , tossing the magazine on the table , “
6192	6210	5930	5930	I	0	” Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee , and she stood up . “
6214	6226	5930	5930	I	0	” she remarked , apparently finding the time on the ceiling . “

6258	6259	6239	6239	Jordan	163	” “
6265	6326	6263	6263	Baker	163	” I knew now why her face was familiar — its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach . I had heard some story of her too , a critical , unpleasant story , but what it was I had forgotten long ago . “
6330	6335	6263	6263	Baker	163	” she said softly . “
6345	6346	6343	6343	you	509	” “

6435	6436	6408	6408	You	159	” “
6440	6448	6449	6449	I	0	” called Miss Baker from the stairs . “
6456	6457	6449	6449	I	0	” “
6464	6471	6458	6458	She	512	” said Tom after a moment . “
6485	6486	6472	6472	They	514	” “
6492	6497	6498	6499	Her family	516	” inquired Daisy coldly . “
6501	6502	6498	6499	Her family	516	” “
6555	6569	6543	6543	I	0	” Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence . “
6576	6581	6571	6571	she	512	” I asked quickly . “
6597	6598	6593	6593	Our	519	” “
6613	6618	6620	6620	I	0	” demanded Tom suddenly . “
6622	6628	6620	6620	I	0	” She looked at me . “
6667	6668	6664	6664	you	0	” “
6678	6734	6676	6676	Nick	159	” he advised me . I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all , and a few minutes later I got up to go home . They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light . As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called : “
6737	6761	6769	6769	Tom	156	“ I forgot to ask you something , and it ’s important . We heard you were engaged to a girl out West . ”
6762	6767	6769	6769	Tom	156	“ That ’s right , ”
6772	6780	6769	6769	Tom	156	“ We heard that you were engaged . ”
6781	6792	6836	6836	they	524	“ It ’s a libel . I ’m too poor . ”
6793	6799	6801	6801	Daisy	155	“ But we heard it , ”
6816	6830	6801	6801	Daisy	155	“ We heard it from three people , so it must be true . ”
6964	6971	6963	6963	he	156	“ had some woman in New York ”
7797	7803	7804	7804	he	558	“ We ’re getting off , ”
7807	7816	7804	7804	he	558	“ I want you to meet my girl . ”
8070	8078	8080	8080	Tom	156	“ Hello , Wilson , old man , ”
8089	8094	8080	8080	Tom	156	“ How ’s business ? ”

8106	8117	8103	8103	Wilson	167	“ When are you going to sell me that car ? ”
8118	8132	8080	8080	Tom	156	“ Next week ; I ’ve got my man working on it now . ”

8143	8150	8152	8152	Tom	156	“ No , he does n’t , ”
8155	8176	8152	8152	Tom	156	“ And if you feel that way about it , maybe I ’d better sell it somewhere else after all . ”
8177	8184	8186	8186	Wilson	167	“ I do n’t mean that , ”
8189	8194	8195	8195	His	167	“ I just meant — ”
8349	8365	8331	8331	her	594	“ Get some chairs , why do n’t you , so somebody can sit down . ”
8366	8371	8373	8373	Wilson	167	“ Oh , sure , ”
8423	8430	8432	8432	Tom	156	“ I want to see you , ”

10967	11004	10958	10958	She	173	“ What I say is , why go on living with them if they ca n’t stand them ? If I was them I ’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away . ”

We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started , but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms . We had an awful time getting back , I can tell you .

11436	11448	11449	11449	she	173	“ I married him because I thought he was a gentleman , ”
11453	11472	11449	11449	she	173	“ I thought he knew something about breeding , but he was n’t fit to lick my shoe . ”
11473	11483	11485	11485	Catherine	173	“ You were crazy about him for a while , ”
11487	11492	11494	11494	Myrtle	172	“ Crazy about him ! ”
11497	11522	11523	11523	She	173	“ Who said I was crazy about him ? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there . ”
11549	11644	11536	11536	I	0	“ The onlycrazyI was was when I married him . I knew right away I made a mistake . He borrowed somebody ’s best suit to get married in , and never even told me about it , and the man came after it one day when he was out : ‘ Oh , is that your suit ? ’ I said . ‘ This is the first I ever heard about it . ’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon . ”
11645	11655	11657	11657	Catherine	173	“ She really ought to get away from him , ”
11661	11683	11657	11657	Catherine	173	“ They ’ve been living over that garage for eleven years . And Tom ’s the first sweetie she ever had . ”

11864	12036	12037	12037	She	685	“ It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train . I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night . He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes , and I could n’t keep my eyes off him , but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head . When we came into the station he was next to me , and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm , and so I told him I ’d have to call a policeman , but he knew I lied . I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I did n’t hardly know I was n’t getting into a subway train . All I kept thinking about , over and over , was ‘ You ca n’t live forever ; you ca n’t live forever . ’ ”

I ’m going to make a list of all the things I ’ve got to get . A massage and a wave , and a collar for the dog , and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring , and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother ’s grave that ’ll last all summer . I got to write down a list so I wo n’t forget all the things I got to do . ”

37795	37841	37741	37741	her	155	“ Very well , then , I wo n’t sell you the car at all … I ’m under no obligations to you at all … and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time , I wo n’t stand that at all ! ”
37842	37848	37850	37850	Daisy	155	“ Holding down the receiver , ”
37853	37860	37861	37861	I	0	“ No , he ’s not , ”
37865	37881	37882	37882	Tom	156	“ It ’s a bona - fide deal . I happen to know about it . ”
37906	37910	37911	37911	He	156	“ Mr. Gatsby ! ”
37925	37937	37911	37911	He	156	“ I ’m glad to see you , sir … Nick … ”
37938	37945	37947	37947	Daisy	155	“ Make us a cold drink , ”
37975	37982	37983	37983	she	155	“ You know I love you , ”
37986	37995	37997	37997	Jordan	163	“ You forget there ’s a lady present , ”
38004	38010	37999	37999	Daisy	155	“ You kiss Nick too . ”
38011	38019	37997	37997	Jordan	163	“ What a low , vulgar girl ! ”
38020	38026	38028	38028	Daisy	155	“ I do n’t care ! ”
38066	38074	38075	38075	she	1511	“ Bles - sed pre - cious , ”
38083	38093	38075	38075	she	1511	“ Come to your own mother that loves you . ”
38115	38147	38094	38095	The child	1514	“ The bles - sed pre - cious ! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair ? Stand up now , and say — How - de - do . ”
38186	38193	38195	38196	the child	1514	“ I got dressed before luncheon , ”
38203	38215	38195	38196	the child	1514	“ That ’s because your mother wanted to show you off . ”
38229	38240	38195	38196	the child	1514	“ You dream , you . You absolute little dream . ”
38241	38244	38246	38247	the child	1514	“ Yes , ”
38250	38261	38246	38247	the child	1514	“ Aunt Jordan ’s got on a white dress too . ”
38262	38271	38272	38272	Daisy	155	“ How do you like mother ’s friends ? ”
38282	38290	38272	38272	Daisy	155	“ Do you think they ’re pretty ? ”
38291	38296	38246	38247	the child	1514	“ Where ’s Daddy ? ”
38297	38306	38308	38308	Daisy	155	“ She does n’t look like her father , ”
38310	38327	38308	38308	Daisy	155	“ She looks like me . She ’s got my hair and shape of the face . ”
38347	38352	38335	38336	The nurse	2152	“ Come , Pammy . ”
38353	38358	38335	38336	The nurse	2152	“ Goodbye , sweetheart ! ”
38404	38410	38411	38411	he	147	“ They certainly look cool , ”
38426	38439	38441	38441	Tom	156	“ I read somewhere that the sun ’s getting hotter every year , ”
38444	38479	38441	38441	Tom	156	“ It seems that pretty soon the earth ’s going to fall into the sun — or wait a minute — it ’s just the opposite — the sun ’s getting colder every year . “
38483	38489	38490	38490	I	0	” he suggested to Gatsby , “
38502	38549	38490	38490	I	0	” I went with them out to the veranda . On the green Sound , stagnant in the heat , one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea . Gatsby ’s eyes followed it momentarily ; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay . “
38557	38558	38550	38550	I	0	” “
38563	38615	38560	38560	you	147	” Our eyes lifted over the rose - beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog - days alongshore . Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky . Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles . “
38622	38628	38629	38629	I	0	” said Tom , nodding . “
38643	38669	38629	38629	I	0	” We had luncheon in the dining - room , darkened too against the heat , and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale . “
38679	38683	38629	38629	I	0	” cried Daisy , “
38696	38697	38629	38629	I	0	” “
38703	38707	38629	38629	I	0	” Jordan said . “
38721	38722	38629	38629	I	0	” “
38729	38739	38629	38629	I	0	” insisted Daisy , on the verge of tears , “
38753	38772	38773	38773	I	0	” Her voice struggled on through the heat , beating against it , moulding its senselessness into forms . “
38785	38792	38773	38773	I	0	” Tom was saying to Gatsby , “
38809	38810	38796	38807	the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage	1531	” “
38818	38830	38796	38807	the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage	1531	” demanded Daisy insistently . Gatsby ’s eyes floated toward her . “
38833	38837	38796	38807	the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage	1531	” she cried , “
38843	38870	38838	38838	you	0	” Their eyes met , and they stared together at each other , alone in space . With an effort she glanced down at the table . “
38877	38932	38871	38871	You	0	” she repeated . She had told him that she loved him , and Tom Buchanan saw . He was astounded . His mouth opened a little , and he looked at Gatsby , and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago . “
38941	38947	38938	38939	the man	620	” she went on innocently . “
38956	38957	38953	38954	the man	620	” “
38961	38967	38953	38954	the man	620	” broke in Tom quickly , “
38986	39005	38938	38939	the man	620	” He got up , his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife . No one moved . “
39009	39016	38938	38939	the man	620	” His temper cracked a little . “
39035	39077	39144	39144	your	1543	” His hand , trembling with his effort at self - control , bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale . Daisy ’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive . “
39085	39089	39144	39144	your	1543	” she objected . “
39105	39106	39107	39107	Everybody	2134	” “
39113	39114	39107	39107	Everybody	2134	” “
39122	39127	39107	39107	Everybody	2134	” she begged him . “
39135	39141	39144	39144	your	1543	” He did n’t answer . “
39148	39152	39144	39144	your	1543	” she said . “
39158	39211	39156	39156	Jordan	163	” They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet . A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky . Gatsby started to speak , changed his mind , but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly . “
39219	39226	39213	39213	you	163	” asked Gatsby with an effort . “
39237	39238	39213	39213	you	163	” “
39241	39245	39213	39213	you	163	” A pause . “
39257	39263	39246	39246	I	0	” broke out Tom savagely . “
39272	39273	39264	39264	Women	692	” “
39281	39289	39264	39264	Women	692	” called Daisy from an upper window . “
39296	39310	39311	39311	I	0	” answered Tom . He went inside . Gatsby turned to me rigidly : “
39323	39324	39325	39325	She	1552	” “
39332	39336	39325	39325	She	1552	” I remarked . “
39342	39346	39347	39347	Her	1552	” I hesitated . “
39354	39447	39347	39347	Her	1552	” he said suddenly . That was it . I ’d never understood before . It was full of money — that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it , the jingle of it , the cymbals ’ song of it … High in a white palace the king ’s daughter , the golden girl … Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel , followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms . “
39456	39471	39472	39472	I	0	” suggested Gatsby . He felt the hot , green leather of the seat . “
39482	39483	39472	39472	I	0	” “
39489	39493	39472	39472	I	0	” demanded Tom . “
39496	39497	39472	39472	I	0	” “
39513	39521	39500	39500	you	0	” The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby . “
39531	39535	39522	39522	I	0	” he objected . “
39540	39551	39522	39522	I	0	” said Tom boisterously . He looked at the gauge . “
39573	39618	39564	39564	You	0	” A pause followed this apparently pointless remark . Daisy looked at Tom frowning , and an indefinable expression , at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable , as if I had only heard it described in words , passed over Gatsby ’s face . “
39624	39638	39622	39622	Daisy	155	” said Tom , pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby ’s car . “
39648	39665	39666	39666	You	0	” He opened the door , but she moved out from the circle of his arm . “
39680	39732	39672	39672	We	1560	” She walked close to Gatsby , touching his coat with her hand . Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby ’s car , Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively , and we shot off into the oppressive heat , leaving them out of sight behind . “
39738	39742	39734	39734	you	1561	” demanded Tom . “
39746	39764	39734	39734	you	1561	” He looked at me keenly , realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along . “
39776	39780	39774	39774	you	1561	” he suggested . “
39814	39834	39835	39835	I	0	” He paused . The immediate contingency overtook him , pulled him back from the edge of theoretical abyss . “
39845	39849	39835	39835	I	0	” he continued . “
39860	39861	39856	39856	I	0	” “
39872	39877	39869	39870	a medium	1563	” inquired Jordan humorously . “
39880	39891	39892	39893	A medium	1563	” Confused , he stared at us as we laughed . “
39895	39896	39892	39893	A medium	1563	” “
39900	39901	39892	39893	A medium	1563	” “
39924	39925	39911	39911	I	0	” “
39935	39940	39927	39927	you	1561	” said Jordan helpfully . “
39945	39950	39941	39943	An Oxford man	2276	” He was incredulous . “
39962	39963	39956	39956	He	147	” “
39971	39972	39967	39969	an Oxford man	2276	” “
39978	39983	39967	39969	an Oxford man	2276	” snorted Tom contemptuously , “
39989	39990	39967	39969	an Oxford man	2276	” “
40010	40015	40004	40004	you	1561	” demanded Jordan crossly . “
40032	40079	40020	40020	she	155	” We were all irritable now with the fading ale , and aware of it we drove for a while in silence . Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg ’s faded eyes came into sight down the road , I remembered Gatsby ’s caution about gasoline . “
40090	40094	40020	40020	she	155	” said Tom . “
40103	40107	40108	40108	I	0	” objected Jordan . “
40120	40162	40177	40177	you	1572	” Tom threw on both brakes impatiently , and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson ’s sign . After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow - eyed at the car . “
40169	40174	40177	40177	you	1572	” cried Tom roughly . “
40188	40189	40177	40177	you	1572	” “
40194	40200	40190	40190	I	0	” said Wilson without moving . “
40206	40207	40190	40190	I	0	” “
40213	40214	40190	40190	I	0	” “
40221	40222	40215	40215	I	0	” “
40230	40234	40235	40235	You	1572	” Tom demanded . “
40243	40276	40235	40235	You	1572	” With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and , breathing hard , unscrewed the cap of the tank . In the sunlight his face was green . “
40286	40290	40277	40277	I	0	” he said . “
40313	40314	40299	40299	I	0	” “
40322	40326	40317	40317	you	1572	” inquired Tom . “
40333	40334	40327	40327	I	0	” “
40342	40353	40327	40327	I	0	” said Wilson , as he strained at the handle . “
40359	40360	40327	40327	I	0	” “
40364	40369	40327	40327	I	0	” Wilson smiled faintly . “
40382	40383	40386	40386	you	1572	” “
40396	40397	40386	40386	you	1572	” “
40420	40421	40422	40423	Your wife	2474	” “
40426	40432	40422	40423	Your wife	2474	” exclaimed Tom , startled . “
40443	40457	40433	40433	She	2474	” He rested for a moment against the pump , shading his eyes . “
40478	40497	40470	40470	I	0	” The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand . “
40504	40509	40502	40502	you	1572	” demanded Tom harshly . “
40523	40527	40510	40510	I	0	” remarked Wilson . “
40548	40549	40540	40540	I	0	” “
40556	40557	40554	40554	you	1572	” “
40561	40693	40694	40694	I	0	” The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions had n’t alighted on Tom . He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world , and the shock had made him physically sick . I stared at him and then at Tom , who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before — and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men , in intelligence or race , so profound as the difference between the sick and the well . Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty , unforgivably guilty — as if he had just got some poor girl with child . “
40702	40706	40694	40694	I	0	” said Tom . “
40715	41004	40707	40707	I	0	” That locality was always vaguely disquieting , even in the broad glare of afternoon , and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind . Over the ash - heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil , but I perceived , after a moment , that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away . In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little , and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car . So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed , and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture . Her expression was curiously familiar — it was an expression I had often seen on women ’s faces , but on Myrtle Wilson ’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes , wide with jealous terror , were fixed not on Tom , but on Jordan Baker , whom she took to be his wife . There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind , and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic . His wife and his mistress , until an hour ago secure and inviolate , were slipping precipitately from his control . Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind , and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour , until , among the spidery girders of the elevated , we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé . “
41014	41018	41019	41019	I	0	” suggested Jordan . “
41056	41059	40707	40707	I	0	” The word “
41061	41093	40707	40707	I	0	” had the effect of further disquieting Tom , but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop , and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside . “
41099	41103	40707	40707	I	0	” she cried . “
41109	41110	40707	40707	I	0	” “
41116	41120	41121	41121	You	1585	” she complained . “
41133	41142	41124	41124	We	1584	” With an effort her wit rose faintly . “
41160	41161	41154	41155	the man	620	” “
41170	41186	41187	41187	You	1588	” Tom said impatiently , as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us . “
41204	41355	41187	41187	You	1588	” Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car , and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight . I think he was afraid they would dart down a side - street and out of his life forever . But they did n’t . And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel . The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me , though I have a sharp physical memory that , in the course of it , my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back . The notion originated with Daisy ’s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths , and then assumed more tangible form as “
41364	41376	41187	41187	You	1588	” Each of us said over and over that it was a “
41378	41449	41187	41187	You	1588	idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought , or pretended to think , that we were being very funny … The room was large and stifling , and , though it was already four o’clock , opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park . Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us , fixing her hair . “
41456	41465	41187	41187	You	1588	” whispered Jordan respectfully , and everyone laughed . “
41470	41478	41187	41187	You	1588	” commanded Daisy , without turning around . “
41485	41486	41187	41187	You	1588	” “
41497	41498	41187	41187	You	1588	” “
41510	41515	41516	41516	You	1594	” said Tom impatiently . “
41527	41544	41516	41516	You	1594	” He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table . “
41554	41558	41551	41552	old sport	2267	” remarked Gatsby . “
41570	41595	41559	41559	You	1594	” There was a moment of silence . The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor , whereupon Jordan whispered , “
41597	41604	41605	41605	I	0	me”—but this time no one laughed . “
41611	41615	41605	41605	I	0	” I offered . “
41621	41629	41616	41616	I	0	” Gatsby examined the parted string , muttered “
41632	41646	41616	41616	I	0	” in an interested way , and tossed the book on a chair . “
41659	41664	41653	41653	yours	1598	” said Tom sharply . “
41668	41669	41653	41653	yours	1598	” “
41685	41686	41680	41680	you	1594	” “
41693	41703	41691	41691	Tom	156	” said Daisy , turning around from the mirror , “
41731	41762	41804	41804	Tom	156	” As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn ’s Wedding March from the ballroom below . “
41770	41775	41765	41768	anybody in this heat	1600	” cried Jordan dismally . “
41787	41791	41778	41778	I	0	” Daisy remembered . “
41806	41807	41804	41804	Tom	156	” “
41810	41815	41816	41819	A man named Biloxi	1602	” he answered shortly . “
41844	41845	41846	41846	They	1603	” “
41853	41857	41846	41846	They	1603	” appended Jordan , “
41892	41906	41889	41889	Daddy	301	” After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent , “
41913	41914	41915	41915	I	0	” “
41925	41929	41919	41923	a Bill Biloxi from Memphis	1607	” I remarked . “
41956	41982	41945	41945	He	305	” The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window , followed by intermittent cries of “
41989	42002	41945	41945	He	305	” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began . “
42008	42012	42003	42003	We	1609	” said Daisy . “
42023	42024	42003	42003	We	1609	” “
42028	42033	42003	42003	We	1609	” Jordan warned her . “
42042	42043	42038	42038	him	113	” “
42046	42053	42054	42054	I	0	” He concentrated with an effort . “
42068	42069	42070	42070	He	113	” “
42074	42078	42083	42083	him	113	” she denied . “
42094	42095	42086	42086	He	113	” “
42130	42134	42135	42135	He	113	” Jordan smiled . “
42155	42165	42143	42143	He	113	” Tom and I looked at each other blankly . “
42168	42169	42143	42143	He	113	” “
42180	42196	42177	42178	any president	1616	” Gatsby ’s foot beat a short , restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly . “
42212	42213	42208	42210	an Oxford man	2276	” “
42217	42218	42208	42210	an Oxford man	2276	” “
42230	42231	42225	42225	you	147	” “
42238	42251	42234	42234	I	0	” A pause . Then Tom ’s voice , incredulous and insulting : “
42266	42288	42234	42234	I	0	” Another pause . A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his “
42291	42311	42312	42312	I	0	” and the soft closing of the door . This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last . “
42319	42323	42312	42312	I	0	” said Gatsby . “
42336	42337	42329	42329	I	0	” “
42364	42384	42354	42354	I	0	” Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief . But we were all looking at Gatsby . “
42400	42404	42389	42389	they	1622	” he continued . “
42418	42460	42389	42389	they	1622	” I wanted to get up and slap him on the back . I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I ’d experienced before . Daisy rose , smiling faintly , and went to the table . “
42467	42471	42465	42465	Tom	156	” she ordered , “
42496	42497	42473	42473	I	0	” “
42502	42506	42473	42473	I	0	” snapped Tom , “
42517	42518	42511	42512	Mr. Gatsby	147	” “
42522	42527	42511	42512	Mr. Gatsby	147	” Gatsby said politely . “
42543	42557	42558	42558	He	147	” They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content . “
42565	42575	42576	42576	You	156	” Daisy looked desperately from one to the other . “
42590	42591	42576	42576	You	156	” “
42596	42601	42602	42602	I	0	” repeated Tom incredulously . “
42663	42682	42650	42650	they	1630	” Flushed with his impassioned gibberish , he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization . “
42689	42693	42650	42650	they	1630	” murmured Jordan . “
42733	42765	42709	42709	I	0	” Angry as I was , as we all were , I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth . The transition from libertine to prig was so complete . “
42776	42787	42766	42766	I	0	” began Gatsby . But Daisy guessed at his intention . “
42792	42797	42766	42766	I	0	” she interrupted helplessly . “
42813	42814	42766	42766	I	0	” “
42821	42826	42766	42766	I	0	” I got up . “
42837	42838	42839	42839	I	0	” “
42851	42852	42844	42845	Mr. Gatsby	147	” “
42860	42864	42853	42854	Your wife	2474	” said Gatsby . “
42875	42876	42871	42871	She	2474	” “
42882	42897	42898	42898	She	2474	” exclaimed Tom automatically . Gatsby sprang to his feet , vivid with excitement . “
42907	42911	42898	42898	She	2474	” he cried . “
42946	42991	42937	42937	her	2474	” At this point Jordan and I tried to go , but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain — as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions . “
42997	43008	42995	42995	Daisy	155	” Tom ’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note . “
43023	43024	43025	43025	I	0	” “
43034	43038	43025	43025	I	0	” said Gatsby . “
43051	43058	43046	43046	you	156	” Tom turned to Daisy sharply . “
43069	43070	43059	43059	You	156	” “
43074	43078	43059	43059	You	156	” said Gatsby . “
43110	43117	43106	43106	I	0	sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to
43125	43126	43120	43120	you	156	” “
43133	43150	43120	43120	you	156	” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair . “
43155	43159	43160	43160	I	0	” he exploded . “
43230	43231	43225	43225	she	155	” “
43234	43242	43243	43243	She	155	” said Gatsby , shaking his head . “
43269	43274	43253	43253	she	155	” He nodded sagely . “
43319	43320	43314	43314	her	155	” “
43325	43350	43321	43321	You	1647	” said Daisy . She turned to me , and her voice , dropping an octave lower , filled the room with thrilling scorn : “
43376	43385	43363	43363	they	1649	” Gatsby walked over and stood beside her . “
43394	43399	43386	43386	Daisy	155	” he said earnestly . “
43427	43434	43409	43409	him	1650	” She looked at him blindly . “
43445	43446	43447	43447	You	1647	” “
43452	43507	43447	43447	You	1647	” She hesitated . Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal , as though she realized at last what she was doing — and as though she had never , all along , intended doing anything at all . But it was done now . It was too late . “
43513	43521	43508	43508	I	0	” she said , with perceptible reluctance . “
43526	43531	43508	43508	I	0	” demanded Tom suddenly . “
43534	43553	43508	43508	I	0	” From the ballroom beneath , muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air . “
43571	43581	43582	43582	Daisy	155	” There was a husky tenderness in his tone … “
43584	43585	43582	43582	Daisy	155	” “
43590	43609	43582	43582	Daisy	155	” Her voice was cold , but the rancour was gone from it . She looked at Gatsby . “
43614	43644	43612	43612	Jay	147	” she said — but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling . Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet . “
43652	43658	43659	43659	I	0	” she cried to Gatsby . “
43676	43683	43668	43668	I	0	” She began to sob helplessly . “
43696	43704	43691	43691	I	0	” Gatsby ’s eyes opened and closed . “
43709	43713	43705	43705	You	147	” he repeated . “
43720	43725	43705	43705	You	147	” said Tom savagely . “
43758	43768	43769	43769	I	0	” The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby . “
43777	43781	43769	43769	I	0	” he insisted . “
43788	43789	43782	43782	She	155	” “
43801	43809	43792	43792	I	0	” she admitted in a pitiful voice . “
43816	43817	43792	43792	I	0	” “
43824	43834	43792	43792	I	0	” agreed Tom . She turned to her husband . “
43842	43846	43792	43792	I	0	” she said . “
43865	43866	43852	43852	I	0	” “
43872	43882	43867	43867	You	156	” said Gatsby , with a touch of panic . “
43895	43896	43897	43897	I	0	” “
43901	43918	43897	43897	I	0	” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed . He could afford to control himself now . “
43923	43924	43925	43925	Daisy	155	” “
43930	43931	43925	43925	Daisy	155	” “
43934	43935	43936	43936	I	0	” “
43941	43949	43936	43936	I	0	” she said with a visible effort . “
43956	43966	43950	43950	She	155	” Tom ’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby . “
43986	43987	43988	43988	I	0	” “
43994	43998	43988	43988	I	0	” cried Daisy . “
44007	44008	43988	43988	I	0	” “
44015	44020	44011	44011	you	156	” broke out Tom . “
44059	44060	44052	44052	I	0	” “
44071	44076	44064	44064	yourself	156	” said Gatsby steadily . “
44087	44096	44097	44097	He	1656	” He turned to us and spoke rapidly . “
44150	44151	44144	44144	I	0	” “
44156	44161	44162	44162	I	0	” said Gatsby politely . “
44178	44179	44166	44167	Walter Chase	309	” “
44218	44219	44220	44220	He	1656	” “
44240	44241	44237	44238	old sport	2267	” “
44252	44260	44261	44261	Walter	309	” cried Tom . Gatsby said nothing . “
44281	44295	44273	44273	Wolfshiem	280	” That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby ’s face . “
44304	44309	44273	44273	Wolfshiem	280	” continued Tom slowly , “
44326	44399	44318	44318	Walter	309	” I glanced at Daisy , who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband , and at Jordan , who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin . Then I turned back to Gatsby — and was startled at his expression . He looked — and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden — as if he had “
44404	44509	44318	44318	Walter	309	” For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way . It passed , and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy , denying everything , defending his name against accusations that had not been made . But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself , so he gave that up , and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away , trying to touch what was no longer tangible , struggling unhappily , undespairingly , toward that lost voice across the room . The voice begged again to go . “
44522	44541	44514	44514	I	0	” Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions , whatever courage she had had , were definitely gone . “
44550	44554	44548	44548	Daisy	155	” said Tom . “
44561	44577	44556	44557	Mr. Gatsby	147	” She looked at Tom , alarmed now , but he insisted with magnanimous scorn . “
44599	44642	44587	44587	I	0	” They were gone , without a word , snapped out , made accidental , isolated , like ghosts , even from our pity . After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whisky in the towel . “
44654	44660	44661	44661	Nick	159	” I did n’t answer . “
44663	44668	44661	44661	Nick	159	” He asked again . “
44671	44672	44587	44587	I	0	” “
44676	44677	44587	44587	I	0	” “
44689	44985	44680	44680	I	0	” I was thirty . Before me stretched the portentous , menacing road of a new decade . It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started for Long Island . Tom talked incessantly , exulting and laughing , but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead . Human sympathy has its limits , and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind . Thirty — the promise of a decade of loneliness , a thinning list of single men to know , a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm , thinning hair . But there was Jordan beside me , who , unlike Daisy , was too wise ever to carry well - forgotten dreams from age to age . As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat ’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand . So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight . The young Greek , Michaelis , who ran the coffee joint beside the ash - heaps was the principal witness at the inquest . He had slept through the heat until after five , when he strolled over to the garage , and found George Wilson sick in his office — really sick , pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over . Michaelis advised him to go to bed , but Wilson refused , saying that he ’d miss a lot of business if he did . While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead . “
44996	45001	44986	44986	I	0	” explained Wilson calmly . “
45023	45242	45002	45002	She	1575	” Michaelis was astonished ; they had been neighbours for four years , and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement . Generally he was one of these worn - out men : when he was n’t working , he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road . When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable , colourless way . He was his wife ’s man and not his own . So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened , but Wilson would n’t say a word — instead he began to throw curious , suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he ’d been doing at certain times on certain days . Just as the latter was getting uneasy , some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant , and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away , intending to come back later . But he did n’t . He supposed he forgot to , that ’s all . When he came outside again , a little after seven , he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson ’s voice , loud and scolding , downstairs in the garage . “
45246	45252	45002	45002	She	1575	” he heard her cry . “
45265	45295	45260	45260	you	0	” A moment later she rushed out into the dusk , waving her hands and shouting — before he could move from his door the business was over . The “
45298	45497	45002	45002	She	1575	” as the newspapers called it , did n’t stop ; it came out of the gathering darkness , wavered tragically for a moment , and then disappeared around the next bend . Mavro Michaelis was n’t even sure of its colour — he told the first policeman that it was light green . The other car , the one going toward New York , came to rest a hundred yards beyond , and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson , her life violently extinguished , knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust . Michaelis and this man reached her first , but when they had torn open her shirtwaist , still damp with perspiration , they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap , and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath . The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners , as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long . We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away . “
45500	45504	45002	45002	She	1575	” said Tom . “
45517	45557	45509	45509	Wilson’ll	311	” He slowed down , but still without any intention of stopping , until , as we came nearer , the hushed , intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes . “
45564	45569	45509	45509	Wilson’ll	311	” he said doubtfully , “
45574	45612	45509	45509	Wilson’ll	311	” I became aware now of a hollow , wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage , a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “
45618	45628	45509	45509	Wilson’ll	311	” uttered over and over in a gasping moan . “
45636	45927	45509	45509	Wilson’ll	311	” said Tom excitedly . He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage , which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead . Then he made a harsh sound in his throat , and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through . The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation ; it was a minute before I could see anything at all . Then new arrivals deranged the line , and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside . Myrtle Wilson ’s body , wrapped in a blanket , and then in another blanket , as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night , lay on a worktable by the wall , and Tom , with his back to us , was bending over it , motionless . Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book . At first I could n’t find the source of the high , groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage — then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office , swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands . Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting , from time to time , to lay a hand on his shoulder , but Wilson neither heard nor saw . His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall , and then jerk back to the light again , and he gave out incessantly his high , horrible call : “
45955	45984	46070	46070	you	0	” Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and , after staring around the garage with glazed eyes , addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman . “
45991	45997	46070	46070	you	0	” the policeman was saying , “
46001	46002	46070	46070	you	0	” “
46007	46012	46070	46070	you	0	” corrected the man , “
46023	46024	46070	46070	you	0	” “
46029	46034	46070	46070	you	0	” muttered Tom fiercely . “
46037	46042	46070	46070	you	0	” said the policeman , “
46045	46046	46070	46070	you	0	” “
46049	46050	46070	46070	you	0	” “
46053	46068	46070	46070	you	0	” He looked up as Tom ’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder . “
46075	46076	46070	46070	you	0	” “
46086	46087	46070	46070	you	0	” “
46095	46096	46070	46070	you	0	” “
46100	46106	46107	46107	She	1676	” repeated Tom , staring . “
46126	46127	46113	46119	Son - of - a - bitch	1678	” “
46133	46137	46113	46119	Son - of - a - bitch	1678	” said Michaelis , “
46147	46148	46113	46119	Son - of - a - bitch	1678	” “
46152	46158	46113	46119	Son - of - a - bitch	1678	” asked the policeman keenly . “
46166	46179	46185	46190	the one comin ’ from N’York	1681	she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she
46204	46205	46185	46190	the one comin ’ from N’York	1681	” “
46215	46220	46185	46190	the one comin ’ from N’York	1681	” demanded the officer . “
46227	46237	46185	46190	the one comin ’ from N’York	1681	” A pale well - dressed negro stepped near . “
46244	46248	46185	46190	the one comin ’ from N’York	1681	” he said , “
46255	46256	46185	46190	the one comin ’ from N’York	1681	” “
46261	46266	46185	46190	the one comin ’ from N’York	1681	” asked the policeman . “
46287	46288	46185	46190	the one comin ’ from N’York	1681	” “
46309	46338	46302	46302	I	0	” Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson , swaying in the office door , for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries : “
46362	46403	46353	46353	I	0	” Watching Tom , I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat . He walked quickly over to Wilson and , standing in front of him , seized him firmly by the upper arms . “
46412	46447	46404	46404	You	0	” he said with soothing gruffness . Wilson ’s eyes fell upon Tom ; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright . “
46450	46459	46460	46460	I	0	” said Tom , shaking him a little . “
46508	46538	46500	46500	I	0	” Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said , but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes . “
46544	46548	46500	46500	I	0	” he demanded . “
46556	46571	46572	46572	He	1692	” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson ’s body . “
46588	46601	46574	46574	he	1692	” Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom . “
46609	46610	46606	46606	your	0	” “
46620	46621	46622	46622	We	1696	” “
46630	46652	46622	46622	We	1696	” I said . Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this , and the policeman turned away . “
46666	46692	46656	46656	you	0	” Picking up Wilson like a doll , Tom carried him into the office , set him down in a chair , and came back . “
46702	46755	46656	46656	you	0	” he snapped authoritatively . He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room . Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step , his eyes avoiding the table . As he passed close to me he whispered : “
46761	46852	46853	46856	The God damned coward	1697	” Self - consciously , with his authoritative arms breaking the way , we pushed through the still gathering crowd , passing a hurried doctor , case in hand , who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago . Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend — then his foot came down hard , and the coupé raced along through the night . In a little while I heard a low husky sob , and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face . “
46858	46862	46863	46863	He	1697	” he whimpered . “
46871	46909	46863	46863	He	1697	” The Buchanans ’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees . Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor , where two windows bloomed with light among the vines . “
46914	46933	46863	46863	He	1697	” he said . As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly . “
46954	46992	46993	46993	I	0	” A change had come over him , and he spoke gravely , and with decision . As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases . “
47030	47036	47011	47011	Jordan	163	” He opened the door . “
47040	47041	47011	47011	Jordan	163	” “
47064	47073	47059	47059	I	0	” Jordan put her hand on my arm . “
47082	47083	47080	47080	Nick	159	” “
47088	47110	47080	47080	Nick	159	” I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone . But Jordan lingered for a moment more . “
47119	47277	47080	47080	Nick	159	” she said . I ’d be damned if I ’d go in ; I ’d had enough of all of them for one day , and suddenly that included Jordan too . She must have seen something of this in my expression , for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house . I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands , until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler ’s voice calling a taxi . Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house , intending to wait by the gate . I had n’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path . I must have felt pretty weird by that time , because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon . “
47283	47287	47280	47280	you	1708	” I inquired . “
47295	47333	47292	47293	old sport	2267	” Somehow , that seemed a despicable occupation . For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment ; I would n’t have been surprised to see sinister faces , the faces of “
47338	47346	47292	47293	old sport	2267	” behind him in the dark shrubbery . “
47356	47363	47348	47348	you	1708	” he asked after a minute . “
47366	47370	47348	47348	you	1708	” He hesitated . “
47375	47376	47372	47372	she	1712	” “
47379	47380	47372	47372	she	1712	” “
47410	47425	47404	47404	She	155	” He spoke as if Daisy ’s reaction was the only thing that mattered . “
47436	47441	47426	47426	I	0	” he went on , “
47467	47490	47461	47461	I	0	” I disliked him so much by this time that I did n’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong . “
47496	47500	47493	47494	the woman	2198	” he inquired . “
47519	47520	47504	47504	Wilson	172	” “
47530	47543	47523	47523	I	0	” He broke off , and suddenly I guessed at the truth . “
47548	47549	47545	47545	Daisy	155	” “
47552	47559	47545	47545	Daisy	155	” he said after a moment , “
47680	47681	47694	47695	old sport	2267	” “
47687	47688	47694	47695	old sport	2267	” “
47697	47701	47694	47695	old sport	2267	” He winced . “
47741	47749	47750	47750	he	0	“ She ’ll be all right tomorrow , ”
47754	47802	47750	47750	he	0	“ I ’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon . She ’s locked herself into her room , and if he tries any brutality she ’s going to turn the light out and on again . ”
47803	47810	47811	47811	I	0	“ He wo n’t touch her , ”
47814	47822	47811	47811	I	0	“ He ’s not thinking about her . ”
47823	47833	47750	47750	he	0	“ I do n’t trust him , old sport . ”
47834	47843	47750	47750	he	0	“ How long are you going to wait ? ”
47844	47860	47750	47750	he	0	“ All night , if necessary . Anyhow , till they all go to bed . ”
47922	47927	47928	47928	I	0	“ You wait here , ”
47931	47944	47928	47928	I	0	“ I ’ll see if there ’s any sign of a commotion . ”
48176	48184	48185	48185	he	147	“ Is it all quiet up there ? ”
48189	48197	48185	48185	he	147	“ Yes , it ’s all quiet . ”
48201	48212	48213	48213	He	147	“ You ’d better come home and get some sleep . ”
48218	48236	48215	48215	his	147	“ I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed . Good night , old sport . ”
48392	48396	48397	48397	he	147	“ Nothing happened , ”
48401	48427	48397	48397	he	147	“ I waited , and about four o’clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light . ”
48552	48559	48560	48560	I	0	“ You ought to go away , ”
48563	48574	48560	48560	I	0	“ It ’s pretty certain they ’ll trace your car . ”
48575	48582	48560	48560	I	0	“ Go awaynow , old sport ? ”

I even hoped for a while that she ’d throw me over , but she did n’t , because she was in love with me too . She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her … Well , there I was , way off my ambitions , getting deeper in love every minute , and all of a sudden I did n’t care . What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do ? ”
49763	49767	49715	49715	Daisy	155	“ Beale Street Blues ”
50054	50064	50065	50065	Gatsby	147	“ I do n’t think she ever loved him . ”
50077	50130	50131	50131	He	147	“ You must remember , old sport , she was very excited this afternoon . He told her those things in a way that frightened her — that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper . And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying . ”
50136	50166	50131	50131	He	147	“ Of course she might have loved him just for a minute , when they were first married — and loved me more even then , do you see ? ”
50176	50181	50182	50182	he	147	“ In any case , ”
50185	50191	50182	50182	he	147	“ it was just personal . ”

55424	55455	55419	55419	He	316	“ Jimmy always liked it better down East . He rose up to his position in the East . Were you a friend of my boy ’s , Mr. — ? ”

55463	55492	55493	55493	He	316	“ He had a big future before him , you know . He was only a young man , but he had a lot of brain power here . ”
55503	55534	55500	55500	I	0	“ If he ’d of lived , he ’d of been a great man . A man like James J. Hill . He ’d of helped build up the country . ”

55777	55836	55837	55837	I	0	“ Well , the fact is — the truth of the matter is that I ’m staying with some people up here in Greenwich , and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow . In fact , there ’s a sort of picnic or something . Of course I ’ll do my best to get away . ”

55858	55915	55853	55853	he	316	“ What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there . I wonder if it ’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on . You see , they ’re tennis shoes , and I ’m sort of helpless without them . My address is care of B. F. — ”

56264	56285	56261	56261	she	1989	“ We ’re getting sickantired of it . When I say he ’s in Chicago , he ’s in Chicago . ”

56378	56483	56375	56375	he	280	“ A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war . He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he could n’t buy some regular clothes . First time I saw him was when he came into Winebrenner ’s poolroom at Forty - third Street and asked for a job . He had n’t eat anything for a couple of days . ‘ Come on have some lunch with me , ’ I said . He ate more than four dollars ’ worth of food in half an hour . ”
56484	56492	56493	56493	I	0	“ Did you start him in business ? ”
56496	56504	56493	56493	I	0	“ Start him ! I made him . ”

56509	56594	56493	56493	I	0	“ I raised him up out of nothing , right out of the gutter . I saw right away he was a fine - appearing , gentlemanly young man , and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good . I got him to join the American Legion and he used to stand high there . Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany . We were so thick like that in everything”—he

56708	56724	56705	56705	he	1993	“ There ’s nothing to get mixed up in . It ’s all over now . ”
56725	56794	56795	56795	I	0	“ When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way . I keep out . When I was a young man it was different — if a friend of mine died , no matter how , I stuck with them to the end . You may think that ’s sentimental , but I mean it — to the bitter end . ”
56816	56823	56824	56824	he	1993	“ Are you a college man ? ”

56852	56874	56875	56875	he	1993	“ Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead , ”
56878	56890	56875	56875	he	1993	“ After that my own rule is to let everything alone . ”
56956	56963	56964	56964	He	1993	“ Jimmy sent me this picture . ”
56973	56977	56964	56964	He	1993	“ Look there . ”
57005	57009	56996	56996	He	1993	“ Look there ! ”
57039	57060	57018	57018	He	1993	“ Jimmy sent it to me . I think it ’s a very pretty picture . It shows up well . ”
57061	57071	57018	57018	He	1993	“ Very well . Had you seen him lately ? ”
57072	57142	57143	57143	He	2000	“ He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now . Of course we was broke up when he run off from home , but I see now there was a reason for it . He knew he had a big future in front of him . And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me . ”
57184	57205	57206	57206	He	2000	“ Look here , this is a book he had when he was a boy . It just shows you . ”
57289	57298	57300	57302	the old man	2002	“ I came across this book by accident , ”
57304	57314	57300	57302	the old man	2002	“ It just shows you , do n’t it ? ”
57315	57321	57377	57377	He	2000	“ It just shows you . ”
57322	57376	57377	57377	He	2000	“ Jimmy was bound to get ahead . He always had some resolves like this or something . Do you notice what he ’s got about improving his mind ? He was always great for that . He told me I et like a hog once , and I beat him for it . ”

58699	58737	58696	58696	Jordan	163	“ You threw me over on the telephone . I do n’t give a damn about you now , but it was a new experience for me , and I felt a little dizzy for a while . ”
58742	58748	58696	58696	Jordan	163	“ Oh , and do you remember”—she
58749	58759	58696	58696	Jordan	163	added—“a conversation we had once about driving a car ? ”
58760	58766	58696	58696	Jordan	163	“ Why — not exactly . ”
58767	58828	58696	58696	Jordan	163	“ You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver ? Well , I met another bad driver , did n’t I ? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess . I thought you were rather an honest , straightforward person . I thought it was your secret pride . ”

59094	59162	59091	59091	he	156	“ He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave , and when I sent down word that we were n’t in he tried to force his way upstairs . He was crazy enough to kill me if I had n’t told him who owned the car . His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house — ”
59168	59223	59163	59163	He	156	“ What if I did tell him ? That fellow had it coming to him . He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy ’s , but he was a tough one . He ran over Myrtle like you ’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car . ”
59242	59296	59297	59297	I	0	“ And if you think I did n’t have my share of suffering — look here , when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard , I sat down and cried like a baby . By God it was awful — ”
