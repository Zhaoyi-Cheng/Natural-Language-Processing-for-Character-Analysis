11110	11116	11117	11117	She	185	“ Ca n’t stand them . ”
11126	11163	11117	11117	She	185	“ What I say is , why go on living with them if they ca n’t stand them ? If I was them I ’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away . ”
11164	11172	11209	11209	her	185	“ Does n’t she like Wilson either ? ”
11198	11202	11204	11204	Catherine	185	“ You see , ”
11213	11238	11207	11207	She	185	“ It ’s really his wife that ’s keeping them apart . She ’s a Catholic , and they do n’t believe in divorce . ”

11343	11409	11306	11306	she	185	“ No , we just went to Monte Carlo and back . We went by way of Marseilles . We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started , but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms . We had an awful time getting back , I can tell you . God , how I hated that town ! ”

11585	11591	11583	11583	Catherine	185	“ Nobody forced you to . ”
11595	11607	11608	11608	she	185	“ I married him because I thought he was a gentleman , ”
11612	11631	11608	11608	she	185	“ I thought he knew something about breeding , but he was n’t fit to lick my shoe . ”
11632	11642	11644	11644	Catherine	185	“ You were crazy about him for a while , ”
11646	11651	11653	11653	Myrtle	184	“ Crazy about him ! ”
11656	11681	11653	11653	Myrtle	184	“ Who said I was crazy about him ? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there . ”
11708	11805	11682	11682	She	185	“ The only crazy I was was when I married him . I knew right away I made a mistake . He borrowed somebody ’s best suit to get married in , and never even told me about it , and the man came after it one day when he was out : ‘ Oh , is that your suit ? ’ I said . ‘ This is the first I ever heard about it . ’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon . ”
11806	11816	11818	11818	Catherine	185	“ She really ought to get away from him , ”
11822	11844	11818	11818	Catherine	185	“ They ’ve been living over that garage for eleven years . And Tom ’s the first sweetie she ever had . ”
11867	11877	11864	11864	Catherine	185	“ felt just as good on nothing at all . ”
12025	12197	12010	12010	her	685	“ It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train . I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night . He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes , and I could n’t keep my eyes off him , but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head . When we came into the station he was next to me , and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm , and so I told him I ’d have to call a policeman , but he knew I lied . I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I did n’t hardly know I was n’t getting into a subway train . All I kept thinking about , over and over , was ‘ You ca n’t live forever ; you ca n’t live forever . ’ ”
12213	12217	12218	12218	she	686	“ My dear , ”
12221	12329	12218	12218	she	686	“ I ’m going to give you this dress as soon as I ’m through with it . I ’ve got to get another one tomorrow . I ’m going to make a list of all the things I ’ve got to get . A massage and a wave , and a collar for the dog , and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring , and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother ’s grave that ’ll last all summer . I got to write down a list so I wo n’t forget all the things I got to do . ”

42212	42223	42210	42210	Daisy	168	“ If we were young we ’d rise and dance . ”
42224	42228	42229	42229	Jordan	177	“ Remember Biloxi , ”
42233	42242	42229	42229	Jordan	177	“ Where ’d you know him , Tom ? ”
42243	42246	42247	42247	He	1596	“ Biloxi ? ”
42253	42268	42247	42247	He	1596	“ I did n’t know him . He was a friend of Daisy ’s . ”
42269	42274	42275	42275	she	168	“ He was not , ”
42278	42294	42275	42275	she	168	“ I ’d never seen him before . He came down in the private car . ”
42295	42330	42247	42247	He	1596	“ Well , he said he knew you . He said he was raised in Louisville . Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him . ”
42334	42355	42331	42331	Jordan	177	“ He was probably bumming his way home . He told me he was president of your class at Yale . ”
42365	42368	42358	42358	I	0	“ Biloxi ? ”
42369	42380	42331	42331	Jordan	177	“ First place , we did n’t have any president — ”
42396	42412	42391	42391	Tom	169	“ By the way , Mr. Gatsby , I understand you ’re an Oxford man . ”
42413	42417	42358	42358	I	0	“ Not exactly . ”
42418	42430	42391	42391	Tom	169	“ Oh , yes , I understand you went to Oxford . ”
42431	42438	42358	42358	I	0	“ Yes — I went there . ”
42451	42466	42443	42443	Tom	169	“ You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven . ”
42488	42491	42487	42487	his	1598	“ thank you ”
42511	42519	42521	42521	Gatsby	166	“ I told you I went there , ”
42523	42536	42487	42487	his	1598	“ I heard you , but I ’d like to know when . ”
42537	42564	42487	42487	his	1598	“ It was in nineteen - nineteen , I only stayed five months . That ’s why I ca n’t really call myself an Oxford man . ”
42584	42600	42601	42601	he	1598	“ It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice , ”
42604	42618	42601	42601	he	1598	“ We could go to any of the universities in England or France . ”
42660	42667	42668	42668	she	168	“ Open the whisky , Tom , ”
42671	42696	42668	42668	she	168	“ and I ’ll make you a mint julep . Then you wo n’t seem so stupid to yourself … Look at the mint ! ”
42697	42702	42704	42704	Tom	169	“ Wait a minute , ”
42706	42717	42704	42704	Tom	169	“ I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question . ”
42718	42722	42723	42723	Gatsby	166	“ Go on , ”
42727	42743	42723	42723	Gatsby	166	“ What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow ? ”
42757	42765	42766	42766	Daisy	168	“ He is n’t causing a row , ”
42775	42790	42766	42766	Daisy	168	“ You ’re causing a row . Please have a little self - control . ”
42791	42796	42798	42798	Tom	169	“ Self - control ! ”
42801	42863	42798	42798	Tom	169	“ I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife . Well , if that ’s the idea you can count me out … Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions , and next they ’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white . ”
42882	42889	42891	42891	Jordan	177	“ We ’re all white here , ”
42893	42933	42891	42891	Jordan	177	“ I know I ’m not very popular . I do n’t give big parties . I suppose you ’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends — in the modern world . ”
42965	42977	42979	42979	Gatsby	166	“ I ’ve got something to tell you , old sport — ”
42988	42993	42994	42994	she	168	“ Please do n’t ! ”
42998	43014	42994	42994	she	168	“ Please let ’s all go home . Why do n’t we all go home ? ”
43015	43022	43023	43023	I	0	“ That ’s a good idea , ”
43027	43038	43023	43023	I	0	“ Come on , Tom . Nobody wants a drink . ”
43039	43052	42994	42994	she	168	“ I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me . ”
43053	43061	43063	43063	Gatsby	166	“ Your wife does n’t love you , ”
43065	43076	43063	43063	Gatsby	166	“ She ’s never loved you . She loves me . ”
43077	43083	43085	43085	Tom	169	“ You must be crazy ! ”
43098	43108	43109	43109	he	166	“ She never loved you , do you hear ? ”
43112	43147	43109	43109	he	166	“ She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me . It was a terrible mistake , but in her heart she never loved anyone except me ! ”
43192	43198	43199	43199	Tom	169	“ Sit down , Daisy , ”
43209	43224	43199	43199	Tom	169	“ What ’s been going on ? I want to hear all about it . ”
43225	43235	43237	43237	Gatsby	166	“ I told you what ’s been going on , ”
43239	43252	43237	43237	Gatsby	166	“ Going on for five years — and you did n’t know . ”
43259	43270	43253	43253	Tom	169	“ You ’ve been seeing this fellow for five years ? ”
43271	43275	43277	43277	Gatsby	166	“ Not seeing , ”
43279	43311	43277	43277	Gatsby	166	“ No , we could n’t meet . But both of us loved each other all that time , old sport , and you did n’t know . I used to laugh sometimes”—but
43318	43326	43253	43253	Tom	169	eyes—“to think that you did n’t know . ”
43327	43334	43335	43335	Tom	169	“ Oh — that ’s all . ”
43351	43356	43357	43357	he	169	“ You ’re crazy ! ”
43360	43431	43357	43357	he	169	“ I ca n’t speak about what happened five years ago , because I did n’t know Daisy then — and I ’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door . But all the rest of that ’s a God damned lie . Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now . ”
43432	43435	43437	43437	Gatsby	166	“ No , ”
43443	43470	43471	43471	He	166	“ She does , though . The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and does n’t know what she ’s doing . ”
43475	43520	43471	43471	He	166	“ And what ’s more , I love Daisy too . Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself , but I always come back , and in my heart I love her all the time . ”
43521	43526	43528	43528	Daisy	168	“ You ’re revolting , ”
43551	43577	43536	43536	her	168	“ Do you know why we left Chicago ? I ’m surprised that they did n’t treat you to the story of that little spree . ”
43586	43595	43596	43596	he	166	“ Daisy , that ’s all over now , ”
43600	43628	43596	43596	he	166	“ It does n’t matter any more . Just tell him the truth — that you never loved him — and it ’s all wiped out forever . ”
43635	43646	43629	43629	She	168	“ Why — how could I love him — possibly ? ”
43647	43653	43654	43654	She	168	“ You never loved him . ”
43708	43714	43715	43715	she	168	“ I never loved him , ”
43722	43727	43729	43729	Tom	169	“ Not at Kapiolani ? ”
43732	43735	43779	43779	his	169	“ No . ”
43754	43772	43779	43779	his	169	“ Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry ? ”
43782	43785	43779	43779	his	169	“ Daisy ? ”
43786	43791	43792	43792	Her	168	“ Please do n’t . ”
43810	43815	43816	43816	she	168	“ There , Jay , ”
43845	43853	43854	43854	she	168	“ Oh , you want too much ! ”
43859	43877	43854	43854	she	168	“ I love you now — isn’t that enough ? I ca n’t help what ’s past . ”
43884	43897	43878	43878	She	168	“ I did love him once — but I loved you too . ”
43905	43911	43912	43912	he	166	“ You loved me too ? ”
43915	43922	43924	43924	Tom	169	“ Even that ’s a lie , ”
43927	43960	43924	43924	Tom	169	“ She did n’t know you were alive . Why — there ’s things between Daisy and me that you ’ll never know , things that neither of us can ever forget . ”
43970	43979	43980	43980	he	166	“ I want to speak to Daisy alone , ”
43983	43990	43980	43980	he	166	“ She ’s all excited now — ”
43991	44003	44004	44004	she	1609	“ Even alone I ca n’t say I never loved Tom , ”
44011	44018	44004	44004	she	1609	“ It would n’t be true . ”
44019	44026	44028	44028	Tom	169	“ Of course it would n’t , ”
44036	44044	44045	44045	she	1609	“ As if it mattered to you , ”
44048	44067	44030	44030	She	1609	“ Of course it matters . I ’m going to take better care of you from now on . ”
44068	44074	44076	44076	Gatsby	166	“ You do n’t understand , ”
44084	44097	44076	44076	Gatsby	166	“ You ’re not going to take care of her any more . ”
44098	44103	44104	44104	Tom	169	“ I ’m not ? ”
44120	44125	44104	44104	Tom	169	“ Why ’s that ? ”
44126	44132	44076	44076	Gatsby	166	“ Daisy ’s leaving you . ”
44133	44136	44104	44104	Tom	169	“ Nonsense . ”
44137	44143	44144	44144	she	1609	“ I am , though , ”
44151	44158	44159	44159	Tom	169	“ She ’s not leaving me ! ”
44168	44188	44159	44159	Tom	169	“ Certainly not for a common swindler who ’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger . ”
44189	44196	44198	44198	Daisy	168	“ I wo n’t stand this ! ”
44200	44209	44198	44198	Daisy	168	“ Oh , please let ’s get out . ”
44210	44217	44220	44220	Tom	169	“ Who are you , anyhow ? ”
44222	44261	44220	44220	Tom	169	“ You ’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem — that much I happen to know . I ’ve made a little investigation into your affairs — and I ’ll carry it further tomorrow . ”
44262	44273	44275	44275	Gatsby	166	“ You can suit yourself about that , old sport , ”
44278	44289	44290	44290	He	166	“ I found out what your ‘ drugstores ’ were . ”
44298	44352	44290	44290	He	166	“ He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side - street drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter . That ’s one of his little stunts . I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him , and I was n’t far wrong . ”
44353	44358	44360	44360	Gatsby	166	“ What about it ? ”
44363	44380	44360	44360	Gatsby	166	“ I guess your friend Walter Chase was n’t too proud to come in on it . ”
44381	44421	44509	44509	Tom	169	“ And you left him in the lurch , did n’t you ? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey . God ! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you . ”
44422	44443	44360	44360	Gatsby	166	“ He came to us dead broke . He was very glad to pick up some money , old sport . ”
44444	44455	44457	44457	Tom	169	“ Do n’t you call me ‘ old sport ’ ! ”
44463	44484	44459	44459	Gatsby	166	“ Walter could have you up on the betting laws too , but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth . ”
44498	44507	44509	44509	Tom	169	“ That drugstore business was just small change , ”
44512	44529	44509	44509	Tom	169	“ but you ’ve got something on now that Walter ’s afraid to tell me about . ”
44602	44607	44600	44600	he	166	“ killed a man . ”
44712	44725	44765	44765	She	168	“ Please , Tom ! I ca n’t stand this any more . ”
44744	44753	44755	44755	Tom	169	“ You two start on home , Daisy , ”
44757	44764	44755	44755	Tom	169	“ In Mr. Gatsby ’s car . ”
44780	44802	44765	44765	She	168	“ Go on . He wo n’t annoy you . I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over . ”
44845	44857	44830	44830	Tom	169	“ Want any of this stuff ? Jordan ? … Nick ? ”
44863	44866	44867	44867	He	169	“ Nick ? ”
44871	44874	44830	44830	Tom	169	“ What ? ”
44875	44879	44830	44830	Tom	169	“ Want any ? ”
44880	44892	44830	44830	Tom	169	“ No … I just remembered that today ’s my birthday . ”
45188	45199	45201	45201	Wilson	180	“ I ’ve got my wife locked in up there , ”
45204	45226	45201	45201	Wilson	180	“ She ’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow , and then we ’re going to move away . ”

45455	45468	45452	45452	her	181	“ Throw me down and beat me , you dirty little coward ! ”

45707	45720	45705	45705	Tom	169	“ That ’s good . Wilson’ll have a little business at last . ”
45760	45767	45768	45768	he	169	“ We ’ll take a look , ”
45772	45777	45768	45768	he	169	“ just a look . ”
45815	45821	45876	45876	he	169	“ Oh , my God ! ”

46662	46711	46655	46655	Tom	169	“ I just got here a minute ago , from New York . I was bringing you that coupé we ’ve been talking about . That yellow car I was driving this afternoon was n’t mine — do you hear ? I have n’t seen it all afternoon . ”

You see , when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive — and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way . It all happened in a minute , but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us , thought we were somebody she knew . Well , first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car , and then she lost her nerve and turned back . The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock — it must have killed her instantly . ”

I even hoped for a while that she ’d throw me over , but she did n’t , because she was in love with me too . She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her … Well , there I was , way off my ambitions , getting deeper in love every minute , and all of a sudden I did n’t care . What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do ? ”

56065	56122	56060	56060	he	331	“ What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there . I wonder if it ’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on . You see , they ’re tennis shoes , and I ’m sort of helpless without them . My address is care of B. F. — ”

56585	56690	56582	56582	he	293	“ A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war . He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he could n’t buy some regular clothes . First time I saw him was when he came into Winebrenner ’s poolroom at Forty - third Street and asked for a job . He had n’t eat anything for a couple of days . ‘ Come on have some lunch with me , ’ I said . He ate more than four dollars ’ worth of food in half an hour . ”

56716	56801	56582	56582	he	293	“ I raised him up out of nothing , right out of the gutter . I saw right away he was a fine - appearing , gentlemanly young man , and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good . I got him to join the American Legion and he used to stand high there . Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany . We were so thick like that in everything”—he

56932	57001	57040	57040	he	1971	“ When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way . I keep out . When I was a young man it was different — if a friend of mine died , no matter how , I stuck with them to the end . You may think that ’s sentimental , but I mean it — to the bitter end . ”

57279	57349	57225	57225	He	331	“ He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now . Of course we was broke up when he run off from home , but I see now there was a reason for it . He knew he had a big future in front of him . And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me . ”
57392	57413	57414	57414	He	1978	“ Look here , this is a book he had when he was a boy . It just shows you . ”

57575	57629	57630	57630	He	1978	“ Jimmy was bound to get ahead . He always had some resolves like this or something . Do you notice what he ’s got about improving his mind ? He was always great for that . He told me I et like a hog once , and I beat him for it . ”
