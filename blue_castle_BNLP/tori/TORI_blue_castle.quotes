2227	2264	2221	2221	Valancy	83	“ I do n’t know why all the girls of today are so sunburned . WhenIwas a girl my skin was roses and cream . I was counted the prettiest girl in Canada , my dear . ”
2280	2289	2275	2275	he	97	“ How fat you ’re getting , Doss ! ”
2361	2375	2377	2378	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ I suppose you ’re busy with your hope - chest these days ? ”
2396	2407	2394	2394	himself	100	“ What is the difference between Doss and a mouse ? “
2424	2670	2416	2416	Doss	98	” Valancy had heard him ask that riddle fifty times and every time she wanted to throw something at him . But she never did . In the first place , the Stirlings simply did not throw things ; in the second place , Uncle Benjamin was a wealthy and childless old widower and Valancy had been brought up in the fear and admonition of his money . If she offended him he would cut her out of his will — supposing she were in it . Valancy did not want to be cut out of Uncle Benjamin ’s will . She had been poor all her life and knew the galling bitterness of it . So she endured his riddles and even smiled tortured little smiles over them . Aunt Isabel , downright and disagreeable as an east wind , would criticise her in some way — Valancy could not predict just how , for Aunt Isabel never repeated a criticism — she found something new with which to jab you every time . Aunt Isabel prided herself on saying what she thought , but did n’t like it so well when other people said whattheythought toher . Valancy never said whatshethought . Cousin Georgiana — named after her great - great - grand - mother , who had been named after George the Fourth — would recount dolorously the names of all relatives and friends who had died since the last picnic and wonder “
2682	3007	2416	2416	Doss	98	” Oppressively competent , Aunt Mildred would talk endlessly of her husband and her odious prodigies of babies to Valancy , because Valancy would be the only one she could find to put up with it . For the same reason , Cousin Gladys — really First Cousin Gladys once removed , according to the strict way in which the Stirlings tabulated relationship — a tall , thin lady who admitted she had a sensitive disposition , would describe minutely the tortures of her neuritis . And Olive , the wonder girl of the whole Stirling clan , who had everything Valancy had not — beauty , popularity , love,—would show off her beauty and presume on her popularity and flaunt her diamond insignia of love in Valancy ’s dazzled , envious eyes . There would be none of all this today . And there would be no packing up of teaspoons . The packing up was always left for Valancy and Cousin Stickles . And once , six years ago , a silver teaspoon from Aunt Wellington ’s wedding set had been lost . Valancy never heard the last of that silver teaspoon . Its ghost appeared Banquo - like at every subsequent family feast . Oh , yes , Valancy knew exactly what the picnic would be like and she blessed the rain that had saved her from it . There would be no picnic this year . If Aunt Wellington could not celebrate on the sacred day itself she would have no celebration at all . Thank whatever gods there were for that . Since there would be no picnic , Valancy made up her mind that , if the rain held up in the afternoon , she would go up to the library and get another of John Foster ’s books . Valancy was never allowed to read novels , but John Foster ’s books were not novels . They were “
3009	3015	2416	2416	Doss	98	books”—so the librarian told Mrs. Frederick Stirling—“all
3031	3186	2416	2416	Doss	98	” So Valancy was allowed to read them — under protest , for it was only too evident that she enjoyed them too much . It was permissible , even laudable , to read to improve your mind and your religion , but a book that was enjoyable was dangerous . Valancy did not know whether her mind was being improved or not ; but she felt vaguely that if she had come across John Foster ’s books years ago life might have been a different thing for her . They seemed to her to yield glimpses of a world into which she might once have entered , though the door was forever barred to her now . It was only within the last year that John Foster ’s books had been in the Deerwood library , though the librarian told Valancy that he had been a well - known writer for several years . “
3192	3197	3198	3198	Nobody	348	” Valancy had asked . “
3265	3266	3251	3251	I	0	” “
3273	3279	3267	3267	I	0	” said Valancy , timidly . “
3284	3300	3301	3301	I	0	” Miss Clarkson smiled in a patronising fashion that relegated Valancy ’s opinions to limbo , “
3326	3639	3314	3314	Foster	106	” Valancy did n’t know whether she cared much for bugs either . It was not John Foster ’s uncanny knowledge of wild creatures and insect life that enthralled her . She could hardly say what it was — some tantalising lure of a mystery never revealed — some hint of a great secret just a little further on — some faint , elusive echo of lovely , forgotten things — John Foster ’s magic was indefinable . Yes , she would get a new Foster book . It was a month since she hadThistle Harvest , so surely Mother could not object . Valancy had read it four times — she knew whole passages off by heart . And — she almost thought she would go and see Dr. Trent about that queer pain around the heart . It had come rather often lately , and the palpitations were becoming annoying , not to speak of an occasional dizzy moment and a queer shortness of breath . But could she go to see him without telling any one ? It was a most daring thought . None of the Stirlings ever consulted a doctor without holding a family council and getting Uncle James ’ approval . Then , they went to Dr. Ambrose Marsh of Port Lawrence , who had married Second Cousin Adelaide Stirling . But Valancy disliked Dr. Ambrose Marsh . And , besides , she could not get to Port Lawrence , fifteen miles away , without being taken there . She did not want any one to know about her heart . There would be such a fuss made and every member of the family would come down and talk it over and advise her and caution her and warn her and tell her horrible tales of great - aunts and cousins forty times removed who had been “
3643	3645	3314	3314	Foster	106	” and “
3657	3676	3314	3314	Foster	106	” Aunt Isabel would remember that she had always said Doss looked like a girl who would have heart trouble—“so
3681	3695	3697	3697	Stirling	83	” ; and Uncle Wellington would take it as a personal insult , when “
3703	3714	3715	3719	poor , dear little Doss	436	” ; and Georgiana would forebode in perfectly audible asides that “
3730	3738	3727	3727	I	0	” ; and Cousin Gladys would say , “
3748	3785	3741	3741	myheart	438	” in a tone that implied no one else had any business even to have a heart ; and Olive — Olive would merely look beautiful and superior and disgustingly healthy , as if to say , “
3800	4067	3795	3795	Doss	98	” Valancy felt that she could n’t tell anybody unless she had to . She felt quite sure there was nothing at all seriously wrong with her heart and no need of all the pother that would ensue if she mentioned it . She would just slip up quietly and see Dr. Trent that very day . As for his bill , she had the two hundred dollars that her father had put in the bank for her the day she was born . She was never allowed to use even the interest of this , but she would secretly take out enough to pay Dr. Trent . Dr. Trent was a gruff , outspoken , absent - minded old fellow , but he was a recognised authority on heart disease , even if he were only a general practitioner in out - of - the - world Deerwood . Dr. Trent was over seventy and there had been rumours that he meant to retire soon . None of the Stirling clan had ever gone to him since he had told Cousin Gladys , ten years before , that her neuritis was all imaginary and that she enjoyed it . You could n’t patronise a doctor who insulted your first - cousin - once - removed like that — not to mention that he was a Presbyterian when all the Stirlings went to the Anglican church . But Valancy , between the devil of disloyalty to clan and the deep sea of fuss and clatter and advice , thought she would take a chance with the devil .
4826	4849	4851	4852	Aunt Wellington	84	“ It is theonlyway that becomes you . Your face is so small that youmustadd height to it by a pompadour effect , ”
4975	5008	4963	4964	Cousin Stickles	89	“ And I always will be — I know it — I ca n’t help it . I do n’t know what it would be like not to be afraid of something . ”
5270	5276	5278	5278	her	83	“ Keep that schoolgirl complexion . ”
5295	5300	5302	5302	Valancy	83	anywhere—“exactly like my life , ”
5451	5458	5461	5462	her mother	343	“ Sit up straight , Doss , ”
5594	5603	5604	5604	she	83	“ Doss will be sure to ketch them , ”
5607	5620	5622	5623	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Doss must not go where she is likely to catch mumps , ”
5736	5744	5746	5747	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ None ofmyfamily were ever like that , ”
5758	5765	5767	5768	Cousin Stickles	89	“ The Stirlings seldom take colds , ”
5776	5780	5782	5783	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ I think , ”
5785	5800	5782	5783	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ that if a person makes up her mindnotto have colds she will nothavecolds . ”
5957	5960	5961	5961	she	83	“ Mother , ”
5965	5987	5961	5961	she	83	“ would you mind calling me Valancy after this ? Doss seems so — so — I do n’t like it . ”
6013	6021	5997	5997	She	91	“ What is the matter with Doss ? ”
6022	6029	6031	6031	Valancy	83	“ It — seems so childish , ”
6033	6036	6031	6031	Valancy	83	“ Oh ! ”
6052	6074	6044	6045	the Wansbarra	116	“ I see . Well , it should suityouthen . You are childish enough in all conscience , my dear child . ”
6075	6082	6084	6086	the dear child	478	“ I am twenty - nine , ”
6089	6107	6109	6110	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ I would n’t proclaim it from the house - tops if I were you , dear , ”
6112	6127	6109	6110	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Twenty - nine!Ihad been married nine years when I was twenty - nine . ”
6128	6134	6136	6137	Cousin Stickles	89	“ Iwas married at seventeen , ”
6346	6356	6357	6357	she	83	“ I have n’t even a gift for friendship , ”
6365	6375	6377	6378	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Doss , you have n’t eaten your crusts , ”
6581	6588	6590	6591	John Foster	106	“ The woods are so human , ”
6593	6955	6590	6591	John Foster	106	“ that to know them one must live with them . An occasional saunter through them , keeping to the well - trodden paths , will never admit us to their intimacy . If we wish to be friends we must seek them out and win them by frequent , reverent visits at all hours ; by morning , by noon , and by night ; and at all seasons , in spring , in summer , in autumn , in winter . Otherwise we can never really know them and any pretence we may make to the contrary will never impose on them . They have their own effective way of keeping aliens at a distance and shutting their hearts to mere casual sightseers . It is of no use to seek the woods from any motive except sheer love of them ; they will find us out at once and hide all their sweet , old - world secrets from us . But if they know we come to them because we love them they will be very kind to us and give us such treasures of beauty and delight as are not bought or sold in any market - place . For the woods , when they give at all , give unstintedly and hold nothing back from their true worshippers . We must go to them lovingly , humbly , patiently , watchfully , and we shall learn what poignant loveliness lurks in the wild places and silent intervals , lying under starshine and sunset , what cadences of unearthly music are harped on aged pine boughs or crooned in copses of fir , what delicate savours exhale from mosses and ferns in sunny corners or on damp brooklands , what dreams and myths and legends of an older time haunt them . Then the immortal heart of the woods will beat against ours and its subtle life will steal into our veins and make us its own forever , so that no matter where we go or how widely we wander we shall yet be drawn back to the forest to find our most enduring kinship . ”
6956	6959	6961	6962	her mother	343	“ Doss , ”
6968	6980	6961	6962	her mother	343	“ what are you doing all by yourself in that room ? ”
7091	7101	7103	7104	her mother	343	“ What do you want to go uptown for ? ”
7106	7117	7103	7104	her mother	343	“ I want to get a book from the library . ”
7118	7130	7209	7209	Valancy	83	“ You got a book from the library only last week . ”
7131	7139	7103	7104	her mother	343	“ No , it was four weeks . ”
7140	7146	7103	7104	her mother	343	“ Four weeks . Nonsense ! ”
7147	7154	7209	7209	Valancy	83	“ Really it was , Mother . ”
7155	7198	7103	7104	her mother	343	“ You are mistaken . It can not possibly have been more than two weeks . I dislike contradiction . And I do not see what you want to get a book for , anyhow . You waste too much time reading . ”
7199	7207	7209	7209	Valancy	83	“ Of what value is my time ? ”
7212	7223	7209	7209	Valancy	83	“ Doss ! Do n’t speak in that tone tome . ”
7224	7230	7232	7233	Cousin Stickles	89	“ We need some tea , ”
7235	7257	7232	7233	Cousin Stickles	89	“ She might go and get that if she wants a walk — though this damp weather is bad for colds . ”
7278	7284	7286	7287	Cousin Stickles	89	“ Got your rubbers on ? ”
7314	7317	7295	7296	Christine Stickles	114	“ Yes . ”
7318	7327	7329	7330	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Have you got your flannel petticoat on ? ”
7332	7335	7329	7330	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ No . ”
7336	7356	7357	7357	Her	91	“ Doss , I really do not understand you . Do you want to catch your death of coldagain ? ”
7371	7381	7357	7357	Her	91	“ Go upstairs this minute and put it on ! ”
7382	7397	7329	7330	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Mother , I don’tneeda flannel petticoat . My sateen one is warm enough . ”
7398	7417	7418	7418	Valancy	83	“ Doss , remember you had bronchitis two years ago . Go and do as you are told ! ”
7483	7486	7479	7479	Olive	93	“ married money ”
7498	7512	7514	7515	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Are you sure you did n’t leave the soap in the water ? ”
7674	7683	7685	7685	Valancy	83	“ I do n’t envy Jennie the man , ”
7696	7737	7738	7738	she	83	ideals—“but Idoenvy her the house . It ’s such a nice young house . Oh , if I could only have a house of my own — ever so poor , so tiny — but my own ! But then , ”
7742	7762	7738	7738	she	83	“ there is no use in yowling for the moon when you ca n’t even get a tallow candle . ”
8126	8130	8167	8168	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ a chance , ”
8189	8192	8194	8195	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Why , ”
8206	8214	8200	8200	he	100	“ are young ladies like bad grammarians ? ”
8232	8240	8218	8219	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ I do n’t know . Why ? ”
8241	8244	8246	8247	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Because , ”
8249	8256	8246	8247	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ they ca n’t decline matrimony . ”
8300	8305	8295	8295	him	100	“ Who is that ? ”
8311	8322	8307	8307	Joe	119	“ Valancy Stirling — one of the Deerwood old maids . ”
8323	8328	8329	8329	Claude	120	“ Curable or incurable ? ”
8354	8359	8343	8343	Valancy	83	“ Twenty - nine , ”
8365	8395	8360	8361	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Dear me , Doss , you ’re dangerously near the second corner and not even thinking of getting married yet . Twenty - nine . It seems impossible . ”
8408	8414	8404	8405	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ How time does fly ! ”
8415	8419	8421	8421	Valancy	83	“ Ithink itcrawls , ”
8482	8492	8494	8495	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ What two ages are apt to prove illusory ? ”
8504	8509	8510	8510	he	100	“ give it up , ”
8513	8520	8510	8510	he	100	“ Mir - age and marriage . ”
8521	8536	8538	8538	Valancy	83	“ M - i - r - a - g - e is pronouncedmirazh , ”
8591	8599	8600	8600	he	100	“ Poor Doss is taking it hard , ”
8639	8649	8624	8625	Uncle Benjamin	100	impertinent—“tome!”—and her mother would lecture her for a week . “
8659	8663	8650	8650	I	0	” thought Valancy . “
8674	8775	8667	8667	I	0	” Yes , it was just twenty , Valancy reflected , since she had first been twitted with her loverless condition . She remembered the bitter moment perfectly . She was just nine years old and she was standing alone on the school playground while the other little girls of her class were playing a game in which you must be chosen by a boy as his partner before you could play . Nobody had chosen Valancy — little , pale , black - haired Valancy , with her prim , long - sleeved apron and odd , slanted eyes . “
8778	8787	8667	8667	I	0	” said a pretty little girl to her , “
8802	8817	8799	8800	a beau	553	” Valancy had said defiantly , as she continued to say for twenty years , “
8822	8835	8818	8818	I	0	” But this afternoon Valancy once and for all stopped saying that . “
8846	8851	8836	8836	I	0	” she thought savagely . “
8893	9020	9021	9022	Little boy	556	” Valancy stopped suddenly aghast at her own recklessness . She felt sure that Rev. Dr. Stalling , who passed her at this moment , read her thoughts and disapproved of them thoroughly . Valancy was afraid of Dr. Stalling — had been afraid of him ever since the Sunday , twenty - three years before , when he had first come to St. Albans ’ . Valancy had been too late for Sunday School that day and she had gone into the church timidly and sat in their pew . No one else was in the church — nobody except the new rector , Dr. Stalling . Dr. Stalling stood up in front of the choir door , beckoned to her , and said sternly , “
9028	9071	9072	9073	Little boy	556	” Valancy had stared around her . There was no little boy — there was no one in all the huge church but herself . This strange man with the blue glasses could n’t mean her . She was not a boy . “
9075	9091	9072	9073	Little boy	556	” repeated Dr. Stalling , more sternly still , shaking his forefinger fiercely at her , “
9098	9170	9171	9172	Little boy	556	” Valancy arose as if hypnotised and walked up the aisle . She was too terrified to do anything else . What dreadful thing was going to happen to her ? Whathadhappened to her ? Had she actually turned into a boy ? She came to a stop in front of Dr. Stalling . Dr. Stalling shook his forefinger — such a long , knuckly forefinger — at her and said : “
9179	9210	9171	9172	Little boy	556	” Valancy took off her hat . She had a scrawny little pigtail hanging down her back , but Dr. Stalling was short - sighted and did not perceive it . “
9228	9248	9249	9249	Doss	98	” Valancy went back to her seat carrying her hat like an automaton . Presently her mother came in . “
9251	9256	9259	9259	you	556	” said Mrs. Stirling , “
9272	9435	9436	9436	His	561	” Valancy put it on instantly . She was cold with fear lest Dr. Stalling should immediately summon her up front again . She would have to go , of course — it never occurred to her that one could disobey the rector — and the church was full of people now . Oh , what would she do if that horrible , stabbing forefinger were shaken at her again before all those people ? Valancy sat through the whole service in an agony of dread and was sick for a week afterwards . Nobody knew why — Mrs. Frederick again bemoaned herself of her delicate child . Dr. Stalling found out his mistake and laughed over it to Valancy — who did not laugh . She never got over her dread of Dr. Stalling . And now to be caught by him on the street corner , thinking such things ! Valancy got her John Foster book — Magic of Wings . “
9443	9694	9436	9436	His	561	” said Miss Clarkson . She had almost decided that she would go home , instead of going to see Dr. Trent . Her courage had failed her . She was afraid of offending Uncle James — afraid of angering her mother — afraid of facing gruff , shaggy - browed old Dr. Trent , who would probably tell her , as he had told Cousin Gladys , that her trouble was entirely imaginary and that she only had it because she liked to have it . No , she would not go ; she would get a bottle of Redfern ’s Purple Pills instead . Redfern ’s Purple Pills were the standard medicine of the Stirling clan . Had they not cured Second Cousin Geraldine when five doctors had given her up ? Valancy always felt very sceptical concerning the virtues of the Purple Pills ; but theremightbe something in them ; and it was easier to take them than to face Dr. Trent alone . She would glance over the magazines in the reading - room a few minutes and then go home . Valancy tried to read a story , but it made her furious . On every page was a picture of the heroine surrounded by adoring men . And here was she , Valancy Stirling , who could not get a solitary beau ! Valancy slammed the magazine shut ; she openedMagic of Wings . Her eyes fell on the paragraph that changed her life . “
9701	9706	9259	9259	you	556	” wrote John Foster . “
9755	9770	9819	9819	he	85	” Valancy shutMagic of Wingsand stood up . She would go and see Dr. Trent .
9919	9929	9916	9916	he	85	“ ‘ Lo — yes — yes — what?—yes — yes”—a
9931	9934	9935	9936	Dr. Trent	85	interval—“My God ! ”
10168	10176	10177	10177	she	83	“ The doctor forgot all about me , ”
10184	10192	10194	10195	Mrs. Patterson	126	“ Well , that ’s too bad , ”
10198	10285	10194	10195	Mrs. Patterson	126	“ But it was n’t much wonder , poor man . That was a telegram they ’ phoned over from the Port . His son has been terribly injured in an auto accident in Montreal . The doctor had just ten minutes to catch the train . I do n’t know what he ’ll do if anything happens to Ned — he ’s just bound up in the boy . You ’ll have to come again , Miss Stirling . I hope it ’s nothing serious . ”
10286	10294	10296	10296	Valancy	83	“ Oh , no , nothing serious , ”
10595	10616	10588	10588	they	592	her—“there ’s that queer little old maid , Valancy Stirling . They say she never had a beau in her whole life”—Valancy

14097	14110	14112	14112	Valancy	83	“ I said I would n’t be rubbed with Redfern ’s Liniment , ”
14114	14149	14150	14150	Valancy	83	“ Horrid , sticky stuff ! And it has the vilest smell of any liniment I ever saw . It ’s no good . I want to be left alone , that ’s all . ”

14975	15088	15089	15089	I	0	”—lies , all lies . Gloom , forsooth ! Nobody would miss her . Her death would not matter a straw to anybody . Not even her mother loved her — her mother who had been so disappointed that she was not a boy — or at least , a pretty girl . Valancy reviewed her whole life between midnight and the early spring dawn . It was a very drab existence , but here and there an incident loomed out with a significance out of all proportion to its real importance . These incidents were all unpleasant in one way or another . Nothing really pleasant had ever happened to Valancy . “
15104	15108	15109	15109	I	0	” she thought . “
15176	15228	15169	15169	I	0	” Those significant incidents kept bobbing up in her mind like unbidden ghosts , without any sequence of time or place . For instance , that time when , at sixteen , she had blued a tubful of clothes too deeply . And the time when , at eight , she had “
15230	15293	15294	15294	I	0	” some raspberry jam from Aunt Wellington ’s pantry . Valancy never heard the last of those two misdemeanours . At almost every clan gathering they were raked up against her as jokes . Uncle Benjamin hardly ever missed re - telling the raspberry jam incident — he had been the one to catch her , her face all stained and streaked . “
15313	15317	15303	15303	they	700	” thought Valancy . “
15351	15380	15341	15341	I	0	” There was that incident of the dust - pile at school when she was seven . Valancy always recalled it when Dr. Stalling referred to the text , “
15403	15470	15471	15474	a new girl ”	2186	” Other people might puzzle over that text but it never puzzled Valancy . The whole relationship between herself and Olive , dating from the day of the dust - pile , was a commentary on it . She had been going to school a year , but Olive , who was a year younger , had just begun and had about her all the glamour of “
15474	15595	15471	15474	a new girl ”	2186	” and an exceedingly pretty girl at that . It was at recess and all the girls , big and little , were out on the road in front of the school making dust - piles . The aim of each girl was to have the biggest pile . Valancy was good at making dust - piles — there was an art in it — and she had secret hopes of leading . But Olive , working off by herself , was suddenly discovered to have a larger dust - pile than anybody . Valancy felt no jealousy . Her dust - pile was quite big enough to please her . Then one of the older girls had an inspiration . “
15612	15715	15471	15474	a new girl ”	2186	” she exclaimed . A frenzy seemed to seize the girls . They swooped down on the dust - piles with pails and shovels and in a few seconds Olive ’s pile was a veritable pyramid . In vain Valancy , with scrawny , outstretched little arms , tried to protect hers . She was ruthlessly swept aside , her dust - pile scooped up and poured on Olive ’s . Valancy turned away resolutely and began building another dust - pile . Again a bigger girl pounced on it . Valancy stood before it , flushed , indignant , arms outspread . “
15721	15725	15471	15474	a new girl ”	2186	” she pleaded . “
15732	15733	15471	15474	a new girl ”	2186	” “
15736	15742	15471	15474	a new girl ”	2186	” demanded the older girl . “
15754	15755	15746	15746	you	708	” “
15765	15803	15756	15756	I	0	” said Valancy piteously . Her plea went unheeded . While she argued with one girl another scraped up her dust - pile . Valancy turned away , her heart swelling , her eyes full of tears . “
15809	15815	15816	15816	You	708	” said the girls mockingly . “
15821	15947	15816	15816	You	708	” said her mother coldly , when Valancy told her about it at night . That was the first and last time Valancy had ever taken any of her troubles to her mother . Valancy was neither jealous nor selfish . It was only that she wanted a dust - pile of her own — small or big mattered not . A team of horses came down the street — Olive ’s dust pile was scattered over the roadway — the bell rang — the girls trooped into school and had forgotten the whole affair before they reached their seats . Valancy never forgot it . To this day she resented it in her secret soul . But was it not symbolical of her life ? “
15961	16188	15955	15955	my	0	” thought Valancy . The enormous red moon she had seen rising right at the end of the street one autumn evening of her sixth year . She had been sick and cold with the awful , uncanny horror of it . So near to her . So big . She had run in trembling to her mother and her mother had laughed at her . She had gone to bed and hidden her face under the clothes in terror lest she might look at the window and see that horrible moon glaring in at her through it . The boy who had tried to kiss her at a party when she was fifteen . She had not let him — she had evaded him and run . He was the only boy who had ever tried to kiss her . Now , fourteen years later , Valancy found herself wishing that she had let him . The time she had been made to apologise to Olive for something she had n’t done . Olive had said that Valancy had pushed her into the mud and spoiled her new shoeson purpose . Valancy knew she had n’t . It had been an accident — and even that was n’t her fault — but nobody would believe her . She had to apologise — and kiss Olive to “
16192	16305	15955	15955	my	0	” The injustice of it burned in her soul tonight . That summer when Olive had the most beautiful hat , trimmed with creamy yellow net , with a wreath of red roses and little ribbon bows under the chin . Valancy had wanted a hat like that more than she had ever wanted anything . She pleaded for one and had been laughed at — all summer she had to wear a horrid little brown sailor with elastic that cut behind her ears . None of the girls would go around with her because she was so shabby — nobody but Olive . People had thought Olive so sweet and unselfish . “
16314	16318	16306	16306	I	0	” thought Valancy . “
16325	16365	16797	16797	God	95	” Valancy had tried to win a prize for attendance in Sunday School once . But Olive won it . There were so many Sundays Valancy had to stay home because she had colds . She had once tried to “
16369	16688	16797	16797	God	95	” in school one Friday afternoon and had broken down in it . Olive was a good reciter and never got stuck . The night she had spent in Port Lawrence with Aunt Isabel when she was ten . Byron Stirling was there ; from Montreal , twelve years old , conceited , clever . At family prayers in the morning Byron had reached across and given Valancy ’s thin arm such a savage pinch that she screamed out with pain . After prayers were over she was summoned to Aunt Isabel ’s bar of judgment . But when she said Byron had pinched her Byron denied it . He said she cried out because the kitten scratched her . He said she had put the kitten up on her chair and was playing with it when she should have been listening to Uncle David ’s prayer . He wasbelieved . In the Stirling clan the boys were always believed before the girls . Valancy was sent home in disgrace because of her exceedingly bad behavior during family prayers and she was not asked to Aunt Isabel ’s again for many moons . The time Cousin Betty Stirling was married . Somehow Valancy got wind of the fact that Betty was going to ask her to be one of her bridesmaids . Valancy was secretly uplifted . It would be a delightful thing to be a bridesmaid . And of course she would have to have a new dress for it — a pretty new dress — a pink dress . Betty wanted her bridesmaids to dress in pink . But Betty had never asked her , after all . Valancy could n’t guess why , but long after her secret tears of disappointment had been dried Olive told her . Betty , after much consultation and reflection , had decided that Valancy was too insignificant — she would “
16693	16795	16797	16797	God	95	” That was nine years ago . But tonight Valancy caught her breath with the old pain and sting of it . That day in her eleventh year when her mother had badgered her into confessing something she had never done . Valancy had denied it for a long time but eventually for peace ’ sake she had given in and pleaded guilty . Mrs. Frederick was always making people lie by pushing them into situations where theyhadto lie . Then her mother had made her kneel down on the parlour floor , between herself and Cousin Stickles , and say , “
16808	16824	16797	16797	God	95	” Valancy had said it , but as she rose from her knees she muttered . “
16837	17422	16831	16831	I	0	” Valancy had not then heard of Galileo but her fate was similar to his . She was punished just as severely as if she had n’t confessed and prayed . The winter she went to dancing - school . Uncle James had decreed she should go and had paid for her lessons . How she had looked forward to it ! And how she had hated it ! She had never had a voluntary partner . The teacher always had to tell some boy to dance with her , and generally he had been sulky about it . Yet Valancy was a good dancer , as light on her feet as thistledown . Olive , who never lacked eager partners , was heavy . The affair of the button - string , when she was ten . All the girls in school had button - strings . Olive had a very long one with a great many beautiful buttons . Valancy had one . Most of the buttons on it were very commonplace , but she had six beauties that had come off Grandmother Stirling ’s wedding - gown — sparkling buttons of gold and glass , much more beautiful than any Olive had . Their possession conferred a certain distinction on Valancy . She knew every little girl in school envied her the exclusive possession of those beautiful buttons . When Olive saw them on the button - string she had looked at them narrowly but said nothing — then . The next day Aunt Wellington had come to Elm Street and told Mrs. Frederick that she thought Olive should have some of those buttons — Grandmother Stirling was just as much Wellington ’s mother as Frederick ’s . Mrs. Frederick had agreed amiably . She could not afford to fall out with Aunt Wellington . Moreover , the matter was of no importance whatever . Aunt Wellington carried off four of the buttons , generously leaving two for Valancy . Valancy had torn these from her string and flung them on the floor — she had not yet learned that it was unladylike to have feelings — and had been sent supperless to bed for the exhibition . The night of Margaret Blunt ’s party . She had made such pathetic efforts to be pretty that night . Rob Walker was to be there ; and two nights before , on the moonlit verandah of Uncle Herbert ’s cottage at Mistawis , Rob had really seemed attracted to her . At Margaret ’s party Rob never even asked her to dance — did not notice her at all . She was a wallflower , as usual . That , of course , was years ago . People in Deerwood had long since given up inviting Valancy to dances . But to Valancy its humiliation and disappointment were of the other day . Her face burned in the darkness as she recalled herself , sitting there with her pitifully crimped , thin hair and the cheeks she had pinched for an hour before coming , in an effort to make them red . All that came of it was a wild story that Valancy Stirling was rouged at Margaret Blunt ’s party . In those days in Deerwood that was enough to wreck your character forever . It did not wreck Valancy ’s , or even damage it . People knewshecouldn’t be fast if she tried . They only laughed at her . “
17434	17438	17423	17423	I	0	” decided Valancy . “
17540	17545	17510	17510	her	88	” Valancy ejaculated the last “
17547	17632	17633	17633	I	0	” aloud passionately . Then she moaned and stopped thinking about anything for a while . One of her attacks of pain had come on . When it was over something had happened to Valancy — perhaps the culmination of the process that had been going on in her mind ever since she had read Dr. Trent ’s letter . It was three o’clock in the morning — the wisest and most accursed hour of the clock . But sometimes it sets us free . “
17647	17651	17633	17633	I	0	” she said . “
17746	17800	17801	17801	I	0	” Valancy got up and dressed , with a deepening of that curious sense of freedom . When she had finished with her hair she opened the window and hurled the jar of potpourri over into the next lot . It smashed gloriously against the schoolgirl complexion on the old carriage - shop . “
17811	17814	17801	17801	I	0	” said Valancy .

18255	18288	18252	18252	she	83	“ Nothing — only just that you ’ve always made me go there . If you ’d made me go to the Presbyterian church I ’d want to go to the Anglican . ”

22883	22895	22873	22874	Cousin Stickles	89	“ We ’ve thought she ’s seemed feverish for several days . ”
22896	22906	22908	22909	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ She ’s gone dippy , in my opinion , ”
22911	22925	22908	22909	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ If not , she ought to be spanked . Yes , spanked . ”
22926	22933	22934	22935	Cousin Stickles	89	“ You ca n’t spank her . ”
22940	22949	22934	22935	Cousin Stickles	89	“ She ’s twenty - nine years old . ”
22950	22966	22968	22968	Valancy	83	“ So there is that advantage , at least , in being twenty - nine , ”
22977	22980	22982	22983	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Doss , ”
22985	23011	22982	22983	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ when I am dead you may say what you please . As long as I am alive I demand to be treated with respect . ”

23112	23156	23109	23109	she	83	“ It was good jam . I ’ve always been sorry I had n’t time to eat more of it before you found me . Oh , lookat Aunt Isabel ’s profile on the wall . Did you ever see anything so funny ? ”
23178	23225	23173	23174	Uncle Herbert	97	“ I — I would n’t eat any more if I were you , Doss . It is n’t that I grudge it — but do n’t you think it would be better for yourself ? Your — your stomach seems a little out of order . ”
23226	23237	23239	23239	Valancy	83	“ Do n’t worry about my stomach , old dear , ”
23241	23269	23239	23239	Valancy	83	“ It is all right . I ’m going to keep right on eating . It ’s so seldom I get the chance of a satisfying meal . ”

23599	23603	23605	23605	Valancy	83	“ Whathashe done ? ”
23622	23631	23608	23609	Uncle Wellington	87	“ Done ! Done ! He ’s doneeverything . ”
23632	23637	23639	23639	Valancy	83	“ Whathas he done ? ”
23642	23666	23639	23639	Valancy	83	“ What do youknowthat he has done ? You ’re always running him down . And what has ever been proved against him ? ”
23667	23675	23677	23678	Uncle Wellington	87	“ I do n’t argue with women , ”
23680	23739	23677	23678	Uncle Wellington	87	“ And I do n’t need proof . When a man hides himself up there on an island in Muskoka , year in and year out , and nobody can find out where he came from or how he lives , or what he does there , that’sproof enough . Find a mystery and you find a crime . ”
23740	23750	23752	23754	Second Cousin Sarah	158	“ The very idea of a man named Snaith ! ”
23756	23768	23752	23754	Second Cousin Sarah	158	“ Why , the name itself is enough to condemn him ! ”
23769	23782	23784	23785	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ I would n’t like to meet him in a dark lane , ”
23787	23798	23800	23800	Valancy	83	“ What do you suppose he would do to you ? ”
23802	23806	23808	23809	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Murder me , ”
23812	23820	23822	23822	Valancy	83	“ Just for the fun of it ? ”
23824	23827	23829	23830	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Exactly , ”
23833	23874	23829	23830	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ When there is so much smoke there must be some fire . I was afraid he was a criminal when he came here first . Ifelthe had something to hide . I am not often mistaken in my intuitions . ”
23875	23885	23887	23888	Uncle Wellington	87	“ Criminal ! Of course he ’s a criminal , ”
23890	23893	23887	23888	Uncle Wellington	87	“ Nobody doubts it”—glaring
23897	23938	23887	23888	Uncle Wellington	87	“ Why , they say he served a term in the penitentiary for embezzlement . I do n’t doubt it . And they say he ’s in with that gang that are perpetrating all those bank robberies round the country . ”
23939	23942	23944	23944	Valancy	83	“ Whosay ? ”
23970	23982	23984	23985	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ He has the identical look of a jail - bird , ”
23987	23998	24000	24001	Uncle James	99	“ I noticed it the first time I saw him . ”
24028	24043	24045	24045	Valancy	83	“ One of his eyebrows is an arch and the other is a triangle , ”
24047	24055	24056	24057	Uncle James	99	“ Isthatwhy you think him so villainous ? ”
24081	24091	24093	24093	Olive	164	“ How doyouknow his eyebrows so well , Doss ? ”
24117	24122	24124	24125	Aunt Wellington	84	“ Yes , how ? ”
24127	24140	24142	24142	Valancy	83	“ I ’ve seen him twice and I looked at him closely , ”
24145	24158	24142	24142	Valancy	83	“ I thought his face the most interesting one I ever saw . ”
24159	24175	24177	24177	Olive	164	“ There is no doubt there is something fishy in the creature ’s past life , ”
24199	24214	24177	24177	Olive	164	“ But he can hardly be guilty ofeverythinghe ’s accused of , you know . ”
24256	24272	24274	24277	Second Cousin Sarah Taylor	158	“ They say he keeps dozens of cats in that hut up back on Mistawis , ”
24312	24323	24325	24326	Aunt Isabel	101	“ That alone shows there is something wrong with him , ”
24328	24336	24338	24338	Valancy	83	“ People who do n’t like cats , ”
24347	24363	24338	24338	Valancy	83	“ always seem to think that there is some peculiar virtue in not liking them . ”
24364	24375	24377	24378	Uncle Wellington	87	“ The man has n’t a friend except Roaring Abel , ”
24380	24410	24377	24378	Uncle Wellington	87	“ And if Roaring Abel had kept away from him , as everybody else did , it would have been better for — for some members of his family . ”
24443	24448	24450	24450	Valancy	83	“ If you mean , ”
24453	24474	24450	24450	Valancy	83	“ that Barney Snaith is the father of Cecily Gay ’s child , heisn’t . It ’s a wicked lie . ”
24575	24580	24582	24583	Cousin Stickles	89	“ Hush — hush ! ”
24585	24593	24595	24595	Valancy	83	“ I do n’t mean to hush , ”
24598	24631	24595	24595	Valancy	83	“ I ’ve hush — hushed all my life . I ’ll scream if I want to . Do n’t make me want to . And stop talking nonsense about Barney Snaith . ”
24796	24812	24814	24815	Aunt Wellington	84	“ WhenIwas a young girl I never thought or spoke about such matters , Doss , ”
24819	24828	24814	24815	Aunt Wellington	84	“ But I ’m not a young girl , ”
24834	24936	24830	24830	Valancy	83	“ Are n’t you always rubbing that into me ? And you are all evil - minded , senseless gossips . Ca n’t you leave poor Cissy Gay alone ? She ’s dying . Whatever she did , God or the Devil has punished her enough for it . Youneedn’t take a hand , too . As for Barney Snaith , the only crime he has been guilty of is living to himself and minding his own business . He can , it seems , get along without you . Whichisan unpardonable sin , of course , in your little snobocracy . ”
24968	24986	24988	24989	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Valancy , your poor father would turn over in his grave if he could hear you , ”
24991	25003	25005	25005	Valancy	83	“ I dare say he would like that for a change , ”
25008	25011	25013	25014	Uncle James	99	“ Doss , ”
25017	25037	25013	25014	Uncle James	99	“ the Ten Commandments are fairly up to date still — especially the fifth . Have you forgotten that ? ”
25038	25041	25043	25043	Valancy	83	“ No , ”
25045	25084	25043	25043	Valancy	83	“ but I thoughtyouhad — especially the ninth . Have you ever thought , Uncle James , how dull life would be without the Ten Commandments ? It is only when things are forbidden that they become fascinating . ”
25127	25167	25121	25121	She	83	“ I am going home now . I only came for the dinner . It was very good , Aunt Alberta , although your salad - dressing is not salt enough and a dash of cayenne would improve it . ”
25194	25207	25209	25210	Cousin Stickles	89	“ She ’s feverish — I’ve said right along she was feverish , ”
25225	25238	25239	25239	he	100	“ She ’s dippy — I tell you she ’s gone dippy , ”
25243	25255	25239	25239	he	100	“ That ’s all there is about it . Clean dippy . ”
25256	25261	25263	25264	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Oh , Benjamin , ”
25267	25288	25263	25264	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ do n’t condemn her too rashly . Wemustremember what dear old Shakespeare says — that charity thinketh no evil . ”
25289	25296	25298	25299	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Charity ! Poppy - cock ! ”
25301	25372	25298	25299	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ I never heard a young woman talk such stuff in my life as she just did . Talking about things she ought to be ashamed to think of , much less mention . Blaspheming ! Insultingus ! What she wants is a generous dose of spank - weed and I ’d like to be the one to administer it . H - uh - h - h - h ! ”
25386	25401	25403	25404	Cousin Stickles	89	“ Do you suppose that the mumps could work on a person that way ? ”
25406	25416	25418	25419	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ I opened an umbrella in the house yesterday , ”
25421	25427	25418	25419	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Iknewit betokened some misfortune . ”
25428	25441	25443	25444	Cousin Mildred	177	“ Have you tried to find out if she has a temperature ? ”
25446	25459	25461	25462	Cousin Stickles	89	“ She would n’t let Amelia put the thermometer under her tongue , ”
25477	25483	25484	25484	she	91	“ I must tell you , ”
25487	25541	25484	25484	she	91	“ that Valancy has been acting very strangely for over two weeks now . She has n’t been a bit like herself — Christine could tell you . I have hoped against hope that it was only one of her colds coming on . But it is — it must be something worse . ”
25542	25551	25553	25554	Cousin Gladys	105	“ This is bringing on my neuritis again , ”
25563	25570	25572	25572	Herbert	97	“ Do n’t cry , Amelia , ”
25585	25589	25583	25583	He	97	“ family ructions . ”
25610	25644	25604	25604	she	91	“ You ’ll have to take her to a doctor . This may be only a — er — a brainstorm . There are such things as brainstorms nowadays , are n’t there ? ”
25645	25657	25659	25660	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ I — I suggested consulting a doctor to her yesterday , ”
25662	25685	25659	25660	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ And she said she would n’t go to a doctor — wouldn’t . Oh , surely I have had trouble enough ! ”
25686	25693	25695	25696	Cousin Stickles	89	“ And shewon’ttake Redfern ’s Bitters , ”
25698	25701	25703	25704	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Oranything , ”
25706	25718	25720	25721	Cousin Stickles	89	“ And she ’s determined to go to the Presbyterian church , ”
25740	25747	25749	25750	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ That proves she ’s dippy , ”
25752	25770	25749	25750	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ I noticed something strange about her the minute she came in today . I noticed itbeforetoday . ”
25777	25789	25749	25750	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ m - i - r - a - z - h. ”
25791	25839	25840	25842	Poor Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Everything she said today showed an unbalanced mind . That question—‘Was it a vital part ? ’ Was there any sense at all in that remark ? None whatever ! There never was anything like that in the Stirlings . It must be from the Wansbarras . ”
25850	25862	25863	25863	she	91	“ I never heard of anything like that in the Wansbarras , ”
25866	25873	25875	25876	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Your father was odd enough , ”
25878	25885	25887	25888	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Poor Pa was — peculiar , ”
25891	25899	25887	25888	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ but his mind was never affected . ”
25900	25912	25914	25915	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ He talked all his life exactly as Valancy did today , ”
25917	26014	25914	25915	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ And he believed he was his own great - great grandfather born over again . I ’ve heard him say it . Do n’t tellmethat a man who believed a thing likethatwas ever in his right senses . Come , come , Amelia , stop sniffling . Of course Doss has made a terrible exhibition of herself today , but she ’s not responsible . Old maids are apt to fly off at a tangent like that . If she had been married when she should have been she would n’t have got like this . ”
26015	26022	26024	26025	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Nobody wanted to marry her , ”
26039	26049	26051	26052	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Well , fortunately there ’s no outsider here , ”
26054	26093	26051	26052	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ We may keep it in the family yet . I ’ll take her over to see Dr. Marsh tomorrow . Iknow how to deal with pig - headed people . Wo n’t that be best , James ? ”
26094	26102	26104	26105	Uncle James	99	“ We must have medical advice certainly , ”
26107	26150	26151	26151	Renewed	181	“ Well , that ’s settled . In the meantime , Amelia , act as if nothing had happened and keep an eye on her . Do n’t let her be alone . Above all , do n’t let her sleep alone . ”
26157	26285	26154	26155	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ I ca n’t help it . Night before last I suggested she ’d better have Christine sleep with her . She positively refused — and locked her door . Oh , you do n’t know how she ’s changed . She wo n’t work . At least , she wo n’t sew . She does her usual housework , of course . But she would n’t sweep the parlour yesterday morning , though wealwayssweep it on Thursdays . She said she ’d wait till it was dirty . ‘ Would you rather sweep a dirty room than a clean one ? ’ I asked her . She said , ‘ Of course . I ’d see something for my labour then . ’ Think of it ! ”
26292	26296	26286	26287	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ The jar of potpourri”—Cousin
26301	26326	26286	26287	Uncle Benjamin	100	spelled—“has disappeared from her room . I found the pieces in the next lot . She wo n’t tell us what happened to it . ”
26327	26337	26339	26340	Uncle Herbert	97	“ I should never have dreamed it of Doss , ”
26342	26361	26339	26340	Uncle Herbert	97	“ She has always seemed such a quiet , sensible girl . A bit backward — but sensible . ”

26402	26412	26399	26400	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Why are chorus girls like fine stock raisers ? ”
26413	26416	26418	26419	Cousin Stickles	89	“ Why ? ”
26436	26442	26444	26445	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Like to exhibit calves , ”
26600	26618	26620	26621	some one	481	“ Yes , I know . It ’s dreadful — be brave — you’ll soon be better ; ”
27077	27081	27082	27082	she	83	“ I wish , ”
27086	27098	27082	27082	she	83	“ that I may haveonelittle dust - pile before I die . ”
27131	27205	27125	27125	Valancy	83	“ Why on earth should I go to Dr. Marsh ? There ’s nothing the matter with my mind . Though you all think I ’ve suddenly gone crazy . Well , I have n’t . I ’ve simply grown tired of living to please other people and have decided to please myself . It will give you something to talk about besides my stealing the raspberry jam . So that ’s that . ”
27206	27209	27211	27212	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Doss , ”
27218	27226	27211	27212	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ you are not — like yourself . ”
27227	27235	27237	27237	Valancy	83	“ Who am I like , then ? ”
27245	27250	27251	27251	he	100	“ Your Grandfather Wansbarra , ”
27255	27258	27259	27259	Valancy	83	“ Thanks . ”
27263	27348	27259	27259	Valancy	83	“ That ’s a real compliment . I remember Grandfather Wansbarra . He was one of the few human beings Ihaveknown — almost the only one . Now , it is of no use to scold or entreat or command , Uncle Benjamin — or exchange anguished glances with Mother and Cousin Stickles . I am not going to any doctor . And if you bring any doctor here I wo n’t see him . So what are you going to do about it ? ”
27391	27398	27400	27400	Valancy	83	“ Do n’t worry , Mother , ”
27407	27428	27400	27400	Valancy	83	“ It is n’t likely I ’ll do anything very terrible . But I mean to have a little fun . ”
27429	27432	27433	27434	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Fun ! ”
27519	27528	27510	27510	her	83	“ Idon’t show my gums when I laugh . ”
27529	27614	27505	27505	Valancy	83	“ More as if she were talking to herself than to me . Indeed , Mother , all the time I was talking to her she gave me the impression of not really listening . And that was n’t all . When I finally decided that what I was saying had no influence over her I begged her , when Cecil came next week , not to say anything queer before him , at least . Mother , what do you think she said ? ”
27615	27624	27626	27627	Aunt Wellington	84	“ I ’m sure I ca n’t imagine , ”
27633	27669	27626	27627	Aunt Wellington	84	“ She said , ‘ I ’d rather like to shock Cecil . His mouth is too red for a man ’s . ’ Mother , I can never feel the same to Valancy again . ”
27670	27678	27680	27681	Aunt Wellington	84	“ Her mind is affected , Olive , ”
27684	27696	27680	27681	Aunt Wellington	84	“ You must not hold her responsible for what she says . ”
27717	27734	27736	27736	Valancy	83	“ You made me apologise to Olive fifteen years ago for something I did n’t do , ”
27738	27747	27736	27736	Valancy	83	“ That old apology will do for now . ”
27774	27781	27736	27736	Valancy	83	“ ever since poor Doss went queer ”

27881	27883	27878	27879	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ It is”—solemnly—“easier
27900	28051	27895	27895	she	83	” Uncle James consulted Dr. Ambrose Marsh . Dr. Ambrose Marsh approved their decision . He pointed out to irate Uncle James — who would have liked to lock Valancy up somewhere , out of hand — that Valancy had not , as yet , really done or said anything that could be construed as proof of lunacy — and without proof you can not lock people up in this degenerate age . Nothing that Uncle James had reported seemed very alarming to Dr. Marsh , who put up his hand to conceal a smile several times . But then he himself was not a Stirling . And he knew very little about the old Valancy . Uncle James stalked out and drove back to Deerwood , thinking that Ambrose Marsh was n’t much of a doctor , after all , and that Adelaide Stirling might have done better for herself .
28833	28836	28830	28830	Valancy	83	“ Cissy Gay ”
29068	29071	29064	29064	he	133	“ dead drunk ”
29106	29121	29123	29124	Mr. Bently	187	“ Have you never done anything in your life that you are sorry for ? ”
29138	29143	29144	29144	he	133	“ Well , yes , ”
29148	29168	29144	29144	he	133	“ There were some women I might have kissed and did n’t . I ’ve always been sorry forthat . ”
29431	29436	29437	29437	She	172	“ with a fellow . ”

29625	29627	29622	29622	he	133	“ hypocrites ”
29730	29754	30057	30057	Valancy	83	“ Do you mean to say that Cissy is all alone there now , with nobody to do anything for her — nobody ? ”
29755	29820	29821	29821	Abel	133	“ Oh , she can move about a bit and get a bite and sup when she wants it . But she ca n’t work . It ’s d —— d hard for a man to work hard all day and go home at night tired and hungry and cook his own meals . Sometimes I ’m sorry I kicked old Rachel Edwards out . ”
29826	30044	29821	29821	Abel	133	“ Her face looked as if it had wore out a hundred bodies . And she moped . Talk about temper ! Temper ’s nothing to moping . She was too slow to catch worms , and dirty — d —— d dirty . I ai n’t unreasonable — I know a man has to eat his peck before he dies — but she went over the limit . What d’ye sp’ose I saw that lady do ? She ’d made some punkin jam — had it on the table in glass jars with the tops off . The dawg got up on the table and stuck his paw into one of them . What did she do ? She jest took holt of the dawg and wrung the syrup off his paw back into the jar ! Then screwed the top on and set it in the pantry . I sets open the door and says to her , ‘ Go ! ’ The dame went , and I fired the jars of punkin after her , two at a time . Thought I ’d die laughing to see old Rachel run — with them punkin jars raining after her . She ’s told everywhere I ’m crazy , so nobody’ll come for love or money . ”
30045	30055	30057	30057	Valancy	83	“ But Cissymusthave some one to look after her , ”
30096	30181	29821	29821	Abel	133	“ Oh , she gits on . Barney Snaith always drops in when he ’s passing and does anything she wants done . Brings her oranges and flowers and things . There ’s a Christian for you . Yet that sanctimonious , snivelling parcel of St. Andrew ’s people would n’t be seen on the same side of the road with him . Their dogs’ll go to heaven before they do . And their minister — slick as if the cat had licked him ! ”
30182	30212	30214	30214	Valancy	83	“ There are plenty of good people , both in St. Andrew ’s and St. George ’s , who would be kind to Cissy if you would behave yourself , ”
30217	30227	30214	30214	Valancy	83	“ They ’re afraid to go near your place . ”
30228	30336	29821	29821	Abel	133	“ Because I ’m such a sad old dog ? But I do n’t bite — never bit any one in my life . A few loose words spilled around do n’t hurt any one . And I ’m not asking people to come . Do n’t want ’em poking and prying about . What I want is a housekeeper . If I shaved every Sunday and went to church I ’d get all the housekeepers I ’d want . I ’d be respectable then . But what ’s the use of going to church when it ’s all settled by predestination ? Tell me that , Miss. ”
30337	30341	30343	30343	Valancy	83	“ Is it ? ”
30345	30381	30343	30343	Valancy	83	“ Yes . Ca n’t git around it nohow . Wish I could . I do n’t want either heaven or hell for steady . Wish a man could have ’em mixed in equal proportions . ”
30382	30394	30396	30396	Valancy	83	“ Is n’t that the way it is in this world ? ”
30413	30418	30420	30420	Abel	133	“ No , no , ”
30431	30479	30420	30420	Abel	133	“ There ’s too much hell here — entirely too much hell . That ’s why I get drunk so often . It sets you free for a little while — free from yourself — yes , by God , free from predestination . Ever try it ? ”
30480	30491	30493	30493	Valancy	83	“ No , I ’ve another way of getting free , ”
30496	30511	30493	30493	Valancy	83	“ But about Cissy now . Shemusthave some one to look after her — — ”
30512	30552	30420	30420	Abel	133	“ What are you harping on Sis for ? Seems to me you ai n’t bothered much about her up to now . You never even come to see her . And she used to like you so well . ”
30553	30558	30560	30560	Valancy	83	“ I should have , ”
30562	30582	30560	30560	Valancy	83	“ But never mind . You could n’t understand . The point is — you must have a housekeeper . ”
30583	30611	30420	30420	Abel	133	“ Where am I to get one ? I can pay decent wages if I could get a decent woman . D’ye think I like old hags ? ”
30612	30617	30619	30619	Valancy	83	“ Will I do ? ”
30621	30627	30629	30630	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Let us be calm , ”
30632	30639	30629	30630	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Let us be perfectly calm . ”
30640	30643	30644	30645	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Calm ! ”
30650	30669	30644	30645	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ How can I be calm — how could anybody be calm under such a disgrace as this ? ”
30670	30681	30683	30684	Uncle James	99	“ Why in the world did you let her go ? ”
30686	30772	30683	30684	Uncle James	99	“ Lether ! How could I stop her , James ? It seems she packed the big valise and sent it away with Roaring Abel when he went home after supper , while Christine and I were out in the kitchen . Then Doss herself came down with her little satchel , dressed in her green serge suit . I felt a terrible premonition . I ca n’t tell you how it was , but I seemed toknowthat Doss was going to do something dreadful . ”
30773	30789	30791	30792	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ It ’s a pity you could n’t have had your premonition a little sooner , ”
30795	30822	30791	30792	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ I said , ‘ Doss , where are you going ? ’ andshesaid , ‘ I am going to look for my Blue Castle . ’ ”
30823	30836	30838	30839	Uncle James	99	“ Would n’t you thinkthatwould convince Marsh that her mind is affected ? ”
30841	30888	30838	30839	Uncle James	99	“ AndIsaid , ‘ Valancy , whatdoyou mean ? ’ Andshesaid , ‘ I am going to keep house for Roaring Abel and nurse Cissy . He will pay me thirty dollars a month . ’ I wonder I did n’t drop dead on the spot . ”
30889	30909	30911	30912	Uncle James	99	“ You should n’t have let her go — you should n’t have let her out of the house , ”
30914	30925	30911	30912	Uncle James	99	“ You should have locked the door — anything — — ”
30926	31097	30838	30839	Uncle James	99	“ She was between me and the front door . And you ca n’t realise how determined she was . She was like a rock . That ’s the strangest thing of all about her . She used to be so good and obedient , and now she ’s neither to hold nor bind . But I saideverythingI could think of to bring her to her senses . I asked her if she had no regard for her reputation . I said to her solemnly , ‘ Doss , when a woman ’s reputation is once smirched nothing can ever make it spotless again . Your character will be gone for ever if you go to Roaring Abel ’s to wait on a bad girl like Sis Gay . ’ And she said , ‘ I do n’t believe Cissy was a bad girl , but I do n’t care if she was . ’ Those were her very words , ‘ I do n’t care if she was . ’ ”
31098	31107	31109	31110	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ She has lost all sense of decency , ”
31112	31162	31109	31110	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ ‘ Cissy Gay is dying , ’ she said , ‘ and it ’s a shame and disgrace that she is dying in a Christian community with no one to do anything for her . Whatever she ’s been or done , she ’s a human being . ’ ”
31163	31180	31182	31183	Uncle James	99	“ Well , you know , when it comes to that , I suppose she is , ”
31194	31236	31109	31110	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ I asked Doss if she had no regard for appearances . She said , ‘ I ’ve been keeping up appearances all my life . Now I ’m going in for realities . Appearances can go hang ! ’ Gohang ! ”
31237	31242	31244	31245	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ An outrageous thing ! ”
31248	31253	31244	31245	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ An outrageous thing ! ”
31283	31351	31271	31272	Cousin Stickles	89	“ I told her — webothtold her — that Roaring Abel had certainly killed his wife in one of his drunken rages and would kill her . She laughed and said , ‘ I ’m not afraid of Roaring Abel . He wo n’t killme , and he ’s too old for me to be afraid of his gallantries . ’ What did she mean ? Whataregallantries ? ”
31370	31414	31352	31353	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Isaid to her , ‘ Valancy , if you have no regard for your own reputation and your family ’s standing , have you none formyfeelings ? ’ She said , ‘ None . ’ Just like that , ‘ None ! ’ ”
31415	31427	31429	31430	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Insane people neverdohave any regard for other people ’s feelings , ”
31432	31440	31429	31430	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ That ’s one of the symptoms . ”
31441	31514	31352	31353	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ I broke out into tears then , and she said , ‘ Come now , Mother , be a good sport . I ’m going to do an act of Christian charity , and as for the damage it will do my reputation , why , you know I have n’t any matrimonial chances anyhow , so what does it matter ? ’ And with that she turned and went out . ”
31515	31524	31526	31527	Cousin Stickles	89	“ The last words I said to her , ”
31530	31560	31526	31527	Cousin Stickles	89	“ were , ‘ Who will rub my back at nights now ? ’ And she said — she said — but no , I can not repeat it . ”
31561	31564	31566	31567	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Nonsense , ”
31569	31582	31566	31567	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Out with it . This is no time to be squeamish . ”
31583	31585	31586	31586	Stickles	89	“ She said”—Cousin
31594	31600	31586	31586	Stickles	89	whisper—“she said—‘Oh , darn ! ’ ”
31601	31614	31616	31617	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ To think I should have lived to hear my daughter swearing ! ”
31619	31628	31630	31631	Cousin Stickles	89	“ It — it was only imitation swearing , ”
31652	31665	31667	31668	Uncle James	99	“ It will be only a step from that to real swearing , ”
31671	31675	31667	31668	Uncle James	99	“ The worst of this”—Mrs
31685	31715	31731	31732	Uncle Benjamin	100	handkerchief—“is that every one will know now that she is deranged . We ca n’t keep it a secret any longer . Oh , I can not bear it ! ”
31716	31729	31731	31732	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ You should have been stricter with her when she was young , ”
31734	31745	31747	31748	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ I do n’t see how I could have been , ”
31753	31772	31774	31775	Uncle James	99	“ The worst feature of the case is that Snaith scoundrel is always hanging around Roaring Abel ’s , ”
31777	31804	31774	31775	Uncle James	99	“ I shall be thankful if nothing worse comes of this mad freak than a few weeks at Roaring Abel ’s . Cissy Gaycan’tlive much longer . ”
31805	31816	31818	31819	Cousin Stickles	89	“ And she did n’t even take her flannel petticoat ! ”
31821	31831	31833	31834	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ I ’ll see Ambrose Marsh again about this , ”
31844	31851	31853	31854	Uncle James	99	“ I ’ll see Lawyer Ferguson , ”
31856	31859	31861	31862	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Meanwhile , ”
31864	31870	31861	31862	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ let us be calm . ”

32669	32697	32657	32657	She	83	“ Cissy dear , I ’ve come to look after you . I ’ll stay with you till — till — as long as you want me . ”

32712	32766	32704	32704	her	172	“ Oh — willyou ? It ’s been so — lonely . I can wait on myself — but it ’s been solonely . It — would just be like — heaven — to have some one here — like you . You were always — so sweet to me — long ago . ”

33682	33687	33689	33689	Valancy	83	“ All the same , ”

But it ’s lovely to have you here — you’ll never know how much it means to me . But Valancy — you work too hard . You do n’t need to — Father only wants his meals cooked . I do n’t think you are strong yourself . You turn so pale sometimes . And those drops you take . Areyou well , dear ? ”

34049	34153	34008	34008	She	83	Valancy’s—“don’t let ’s talk any more about my being sick . Let ’s just forget it . Let ’s pretend I ’m a little girl again — and you have come here to play with me . I used to wish that long ago — wish that you could come . I knew you could n’t , of course . But how I did wish it ! You always seemed so different from the other girls — so kind and sweet — and as if you had something in yourself nobody knew about — some dear , pretty secret . Hadyou , Valancy ? ”
34154	34161	34163	34163	Valancy	83	“ I had my Blue Castle , ”
34214	34225	34227	34227	Cissy	172	“ Every one has a Blue Castle , I think , ”
34230	34246	34247	34247	She	172	“ Only every one has a different name for it . Ihad mine — once . ”
34613	34621	34607	34607	his	1033	“ Good - evening , Miss Stirling . ”
34718	34727	34728	34728	Barney	132	“ I ’m going over to the Port , ”
34732	34748	34728	34728	Barney	132	“ Can I acquire merit by getting or doing anything there for you or Cissy ? ”
34749	34759	34761	34761	Valancy	83	“ Will you get some salt codfish for us ? ”
34822	34852	34809	34809	she	83	“ Certainly . You ’re sure there ’s nothing else ? Lots of room in Lady Jane Grey Slosson . And she always gets backsometime , does Lady Jane . ”
34853	34863	34865	34865	Valancy	83	“ I do n’t think there ’s anything more , ”
34904	34933	34897	34897	he	1047	“ Miss Stirling , you ’re a brick ! You ’re a whole cartload of bricks . To come here and look after Cissy — under the circumstances . ”
34934	34943	34945	34945	Valancy	83	“ There ’s nothing so bricky about that , ”
34947	34995	34897	34897	he	1047	“ I ’d nothing else to do . And — I like it here . I do n’t feel as if I ’d done anything specially meritorious . Mr. Gay is paying me fair wages . I never earned any money before — and I like it . ”
35030	35048	35050	35050	Barney	132	“ All the money in the world could n’t buy what you ’re doing for Cissy Gay , ”
35052	35094	35050	35050	Barney	132	“ It ’s splendid and fine of you . And if there ’s anything I can do to help you in any way , you have only to let me know . If Roaring Abel ever tries to annoy you — — ”
35095	35111	35113	35113	Valancy	83	“ He does n’t . He ’s lovely to me . I like Roaring Abel , ”
35116	35144	35113	35113	Valancy	83	“ So do I. But there ’s one stage of his drunkenness — perhaps you have n’t encountered it yet — when he sings ribald songs — — ”
35145	35194	35050	35050	Barney	132	“ Oh , yes . He came home last night like that . Cissy and I just went to our room and shut ourselves in where we could n’t hear him . He apologised this morning . I ’m not afraid of any of Roaring Abel ’s stages . ”
35195	35214	35216	35216	Barney	132	“ Well , I ’m sure he ’ll be decent to you , apart from his inebriated yowls , ”
35218	35236	35216	35216	Barney	132	“ And I ’ve told him he ’s got to stop damning things when you ’re around . ”
35237	35240	35242	35242	Valancy	83	“ Why ? ”
35277	35286	35268	35269	Barney Snaith	132	“ I often feel like damning things myself . ”
35332	35360	35329	35329	he	1051	“ It will be a relief to have some one to do it for you , then . So you do n’t want anything but salt codfish ? ”
35361	35401	35402	35402	Barney	132	“ Not tonight . But I dare say I ’ll have some errands for you very often when you go to Port Lawrence . I ca n’t trust Mr. Gay to remember to bring all the things I want . ”
35600	35607	35609	35609	Cissy	172	“ But he is n’t bad , ”
35611	35629	35609	35609	Cissy	172	“ Nobody need ever tell me he is . Hecan’thave done a thing to be ashamed of . ”
35630	35640	35642	35642	Valancy	83	“ Then why does he live as he does ? ”
35650	35687	35646	35646	somebody	569	“ I do n’t know . He ’s a mystery . And of course there ’s something behind it , but Iknowit is n’t disgrace . Barney Snaith simply could n’t do anything disgraceful , Valancy . ”
35837	35854	35855	35855	Cissy	172	“ You do n’t know what Barney has been to me , these past two years , ”
35860	35868	35855	35855	Cissy	172	“ Everythingwould have been unbearable without him . ”
35869	35897	35898	35898	Barney	132	“ Cissy Gay is the sweetest girl I ever knew — and there ’s a man somewhere I ’d like to shoot if I could find him , ”
35957	35959	35949	35949	Barney	132	“ shacks ”
36067	36072	36073	36073	he	1051	“ Found no gold , ”
36076	36110	36073	36073	he	1051	“ Came away poorer than when I went . But such a place to live ! Those silences at the back of the north windgotme . I ’ve never belonged to myself since . ”
36156	36169	36171	36171	Valancy	83	“ I like a man whose eyes say more than his lips , ”
36282	36292	36293	36293	he	1051	“ I ’ve been watching a woodpecker all day , ”
36556	36559	36561	36561	Barney	132	“ Piffle , ”
36643	36646	36648	36648	Valancy	83	“ Butwhy ? ”
36659	36678	36648	36648	Valancy	83	“ I ’m doing honest work for honest pay . What is there in that that is disgraceful ? ”
36679	36686	36688	36689	Uncle James	99	“ Do n’t quibble , Valancy , ”
36692	36727	36688	36689	Uncle James	99	“ This is no fit place for you to be , and you know it . Why , I ’m told that jail - bird , Snaith , is hanging around here every evening . ”
36728	36731	36733	36733	Valancy	83	“ Noteveryevening , ”
36736	36744	36733	36733	Valancy	83	“ No , not quite every evening . ”
36745	36752	36754	36755	Uncle James	99	“ It’s — it ’s insufferable ! ”
36758	36784	36754	36755	Uncle James	99	“ Valancy , youmustcome home . We wo n’t judge you harshly . I assure you we wo n’t . We will overlook all this . ”
36785	36789	36791	36791	Valancy	83	“ Thank you , ”
36793	36801	36803	36804	Uncle James	99	“ Have you no sense of shame ? ”
36806	36823	36824	36824	Valancy	83	“ Oh , yes . But the thingsIam ashamed of are not the thingsyouare ashamed of . ”
36850	36883	36847	36847	his	99	“ We know your mind is n’t just right . We ’ll make allowances . But youmustcome home . You shall not stay here with that drunken , blasphemous old scoundrel — — ”
36884	36895	36897	36898	Roaring Abel	133	“ Were you by any chance referring tome , MisterStirling ? ”
36920	36925	36847	36847	his	99	“ old Jim Stirling ’s ”
36954	36999	37000	37001	James Stirling	210	“ I was . And , furthermore , I want to tell you that you have acted an iniquitous part in luring this weak and unfortunate girl away from her home and friends , and I will have you punished yet for it — — ”
37055	37064	37065	37065	he	133	“ The next time you come back here , ”
37068	37100	37065	37065	he	133	“ I ’ll throw you through the window — and all the better if the window is shut ! Coming here , thinking yourself God to put the world to rights ! ”
37168	37235	37163	37163	his	133	“ He ’ll think of that for years when he wakes up in the night . The Almighty made a mistake in making so many Stirlings . But since they are made , we ’ve got to reckon with them . Too many to kill out . But if they come here bothering you I ’ll shoo ’em off before a cat could lick its ear . ”
37401	37411	37398	37398	He	123	“ Can you tell me where I ’m going ? ”
37412	37426	37428	37428	Abel	133	“ How the devil should I know where you ’re going , gosling ? ”
37538	37542	37544	37545	Dr. Stalling	123	“ Mr. Gay , ”
37550	37562	37544	37545	Dr. Stalling	123	“ may I see Miss Stirling alone for a few minutes ? ”
37611	37618	37619	37619	he	133	“ No , no , mister , ”
37623	37668	37619	37619	he	133	“ That would n’t do — wouldn’t do at all . I ’ve got the reputation of my household to keep up . I ’ve got to chaperone this young lady . Ca n’t have any sparkin ’ going on here behind my back . ”
37693	37702	37703	37703	he	133	“ D’ye know anything about it , anyway ? ”
37707	37710	37703	37703	he	133	“ Aboutwhat ? ”
37711	37714	37716	37716	Abel	133	“ Sparking , ”
37754	37785	37750	37750	himself	123	“ Miss Stirling , I am here in response to your mother ’s wishes . She begged me to come . I am charged with some messages from her . Will you”—he
37788	37793	37744	37744	his	123	forefinger—“will you hear them ? ”
37794	37797	37799	37799	Valancy	83	“ Yes , ”
37814	37829	37835	37836	Roaring Abel	133	“ The first is this . If you will leave this — this — — ”
37830	37833	37835	37836	Roaring Abel	133	“ House , ”
37838	37862	37835	37836	Roaring Abel	133	“ H - o - u - s - e. Troubled with an impediment in your speech , ai n’t you , Mister ? ”
37863	37890	37835	37836	Roaring Abel	133	“ — thisplaceand return to your home , Mr. James Stirling will himself pay for a good nurse to come here and wait on Miss Gay . ”
37941	37946	37948	37948	Abel	133	“ That’smybusiness , Mister , ”
37950	38063	37948	37948	Abel	133	“ Miss Stirling can go if she pleases , or stay if she pleases . I made a fair bargain with her , and she ’s free to conclude it when she likes . She gives me meals that stick to my ribs . She do n’t forget to put salt in the porridge . She never slams doors , and when she has nothing to say she do n’t talk . That ’s uncanny in a woman , you know , Mister . I ’m satisfied . If she is n’t , she ’s free to go . But no woman comes here in Jim Stirling ’s pay . If any one does”—Abel
38070	38087	37948	37948	Abel	133	polite—“I’ll spatter the road with her brains . Tell him that with A. Gay ’s compliments . ”
38088	38100	38102	38102	Valancy	83	“ Dr. Stalling , a nurse is not what Cissy needs , ”
38105	38142	38102	38102	Valancy	83	“ She is n’t so ill as that , yet . What she wants is companionship — somebody she knows and likes just to live with her . You can understand that , I ’m sure . ”
38143	38156	38157	38158	Dr. Stalling	123	“ I understand that your motive is quite — ahem — commendable . ”
38220	38251	38275	38276	Dr. Stalling	123	“ But your first duty is to your mother . Sheneeds you . She implores you to come home — she will forgive everything if you will only come home . ”
38252	38260	38262	38262	Abel	133	“ That ’s a pretty little thought , ”
38280	38288	38275	38276	Dr. Stalling	123	“ She entreats , but I , Miss Stirling,”—Dr
38298	38329	38293	38293	he	123	Jehovah—“I command . As your pastor and spiritual guide , I command you to come home with me — this very day . Get your hat and coat and comenow . ”
38348	38354	38356	38357	Roaring Abel	133	“ She ’s giving in , ”
38359	38378	38356	38357	Roaring Abel	133	“ She ’ll go with him . Beats all , the power these preacher fellows have over women . ”
38466	38473	38488	38488	Valancy	83	“ Fear is the original sin , ”
38492	38514	38488	38488	Valancy	83	“ Almost all the evil in the world has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of something . ”
38546	38550	38551	38551	she	83	“ Dr. Stalling , ”
38555	38599	38551	38551	she	83	“ I do not at present oweanyduty to my mother . She is quite well ; she has all the assistance and companionship she requires ; she does not need me at all . Iamneeded here . I am going to stay here . ”
38600	38607	38609	38610	Roaring Abel	133	“ There ’s spunk for you , ”
38629	38647	38616	38616	his	123	“ Miss Stirling , is therenothingthat can influence you ? Do you remember your childhood days — — ”
38648	38655	38551	38551	she	83	“ Perfectly . And hate them . ”
38656	38668	38616	38616	his	123	“ Do you realise what people will say ? What theyaresaying ? ”
38669	38675	38677	38677	Valancy	83	“ I can imagine it , ”
38694	38736	38686	38686	She	83	“ I have n’t listened to the gossip of Deerwood teaparties and sewing circles twenty years for nothing . But , Dr. Stalling , it does n’t matter in the least to me what they say — not in the least . ”
38835	38879	38832	38832	she	83	“ And now that you have got all that out of your system , Cousin Georgiana , can you tell me how to make creamed codfish so that it will not be as thick as porridge and as salt as the Dead Sea ? ”
38880	38887	38889	38890	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ We ’ll just have towait , ”
38892	38914	38889	38890	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ After all , Cissy Gay ca n’t live long . Dr. Marsh tells me she may drop off any day . ”
39047	39048	39031	39031	She	83	“ home”—but

39585	39595	39578	39578	Valancy	83	“ We ’ll hear something worse thanthatabout her soon , ”
39628	39631	39604	39604	Valancy	83	“ up back ”
39701	39710	39711	39711	he	133	“ You come with me to the dance , ”
39714	39740	39711	39711	he	133	“ It ’ll do you good — put some colour in your face . You look peaked — you want something to liven you up . ”
40082	40095	40097	40097	Cissy	172	“ You look so nice and — and — different , dear , ”
40099	40120	40097	40097	Cissy	172	“ Like a green moonbeam with a gleam of red in it , if there could be such a thing . ”
40127	40140	40121	40121	Valancy	83	“ I do n’t feel right about leaving you alone , Cissy . ”
40141	40259	40097	40097	Cissy	172	“ Oh , I ’ll be all right . I feel better tonight than I have for a long while . I ’ve been feeling badly to see you sticking here so closely on my account . I hope you ’ll have a nice time . I never was at a party at the Corners , but I used to go sometimes , long ago , to dances up back . We always had good times . And you need n’t be afraid of Father being drunk tonight . He never drinks when he engages to play for a party . But — there may be — liquor . What will you do if it gets rough ? ”
40260	40266	40378	40378	she	172	“ Nobody would molest me . ”
40267	40288	40121	40121	Valancy	83	“ Not seriously , I suppose . Father would see to that . But itmightbe noisy and — and unpleasant . ”
40289	40332	40333	40333	Cissy	172	“ I wo n’t mind . I ’m only going as a looker - on . I do n’t expect to dance . I just want toseewhat a party up back is like . I ’ve never seen anything except decorous Deerwood . ”
40347	40350	40338	40338	She	172	“ up back ”

40667	40689	40636	40642	the “ up back ” young men	1150	“ Nope . Guess she ’s from out front . The Port , maybe . Got a stylish look to her . ”
40690	40708	40636	40642	the “ up back ” young men	1150	“ No beaut but cute - looking , I ’ll say . ‘ Jever see such eyes ? ”

41443	41449	41451	41452	Barney Snaith	132	“ This way — quick , ”
41475	41489	41454	41454	He	1179	“ Quick — we must run for it — they’ll be after us . ”

41651	41664	41666	41666	Barney	132	“ What a goose you were to come to such a place ! ”
41668	41683	41685	41685	Valancy	83	“ I — didn’t — know — it — would — be like this , ”
41687	41694	41685	41685	Valancy	83	“ Youshouldhave known . Chidley Corners ! ”
41695	41708	41709	41709	Valancy	83	“ It — was — just — a name — to me . ”
41722	41726	41727	41727	She	83	“ up back . ”
41762	41830	41831	41831	Valancy	83	“ When I drifted in at Abel ’s this evening and Cissy told me you ’d come here I was amazed . And downright scared . Cissy told me she was worried about you but had n’t liked to say anything to dissuade you for fear you ’d think she was thinking selfishly about herself . So I came on up here instead of going to Deerwood . ”
41857	41898	41847	41847	he	1186	“ As soon as they stop hunting for us we ’ll sneak around to the Muskoka road . I left Lady Jane down there . I ’ll take you home . I suppose you ’ve had enough of your party . ”
41899	41902	41904	41904	Valancy	83	“ Quite , ”
42193	42238	42187	42187	Investigated	223	“ I ’m a doddering idiot . Out of gas . I knew I was short when I left home , but I meant to fill up in Deerwood . Then I forgot all about it in my hurry to get to the Corners . ”
42239	42245	42247	42247	Valancy	83	“ What can we do ? ”
42250	42348	42247	42247	Valancy	83	“ I do n’t know . There ’s no gas nearer than Deerwood , nine miles away . And I do n’t dare leave you here alone . There are always tramps on this road — and some of those crazy fools back at the Corners may come straggling along presently . There were boys there from the Port . As far as I can see , the best thing to do is for us just to sit patiently here until some car comes along and lends us enough gas to get to Roaring Abel ’s with . ”
42349	42359	42361	42361	Valancy	83	“ Well , what ’s the matter with that ? ”
42363	42373	42375	42375	Barney	132	“ We may have to sit here all night , ”
42377	42383	42385	42385	Valancy	83	“ I do n’t mind , ”
42393	42411	42387	42387	Barney	132	“ If you do n’t , I need n’t . I have n’t any reputation to lose . ”
42412	42416	42418	42418	Valancy	83	“ Nor I , ”
42421	42428	42430	42430	Barney	132	“ We ’ll just sit here , ”
42432	42462	42430	42430	Barney	132	“ and if we think of anything worth while saying we ’ll say it . Otherwise , not . Do n’t imagine you ’re bound to talk to me . ”
42463	42468	42470	42470	Valancy	83	“ John Foster says , ”
42472	42521	42470	42470	Valancy	83	“ ‘ If you can sit in silence with a person for half an hour and yet be entirely comfortable , you and that person can be friends . If you can not , friends you ’ll never be and you need not waste time in trying . ’ ”
42522	42535	42537	42537	Barney	132	“ Evidently John Foster says a sensible thing once in a while , ”
43175	43181	43183	43183	Barney	132	“ Ever dream of ballooning ? ”
43186	43189	43191	43191	Valancy	83	“ No , ”
43193	43242	43191	43191	Valancy	83	“ I do — often . Dream of sailing through the clouds — seeing the glories of sunset — spending hours in the midst of a terrific storm with lightning playing above and below you — skimming above a silver cloud floor under a full moon — wonderful ! ”
43243	43249	43251	43251	Valancy	83	“ It does sound so , ”
43253	43263	43251	43251	Valancy	83	“ I ’ve stayed on earth in my dreams . ”
43326	43330	43314	43314	She	83	“ up back . ”
43331	43342	43343	43343	she	83	“ You see — I’ve never had any real life , ”
43346	43362	43343	43343	she	83	“ I ’ve just — breathed . Every door has always been shut to me . ”
43363	43370	43372	43372	Barney	132	“ But you ’re still young , ”
43374	43393	43395	43395	Valancy	83	“ Oh , I know . Yes , I ’m ‘ still young’—but that ’s so different fromyoung , ”
43433	43441	43442	43442	she	83	“ Though I never was really young , ”
43444	43447	43448	43448	she	83	on—“until tonight , ”
43454	43469	43448	43448	she	83	“ I never had a life like other girls . You could n’t understand . Why,”—she
43481	43501	43448	43448	she	83	her—“I did n’t even love my mother . Is n’t it awful that I do n’t love my mother ? ”
43502	43509	43511	43511	Barney	132	“ Rather awful — for her , ”
43514	43575	43511	43511	Barney	132	“ Oh , she did n’t know it . She took my love for granted . And I was n’t any use or comfort to her or anybody . I was just a — a — vegetable . And I got tired of it . That ’s why I came to keep house for Mr. Gay and look after Cissy . ”
43576	43588	43448	43448	she	83	“ And I suppose your people thought you ’d gone mad . ”
43589	43598	43600	43600	Valancy	83	“ They did — and do — literally , ”
43602	43663	43600	43600	Valancy	83	“ But it ’s a comfort to them . They ’d rather believe me mad than bad . There ’s no other alternative . But I ’ve beenlivingsince I came to Mr. Gay ’s . It ’s been a delightful experience . I suppose I ’ll pay for it when I have to go back — but I ’ll havehadit . ”
43664	43669	43671	43671	Barney	132	“ That ’s true , ”
43673	43714	43671	43671	Barney	132	“ If you buy your experience it ’s your own . So it ’s no matter how much you pay for it . Somebody else ’s experience can never be yours . Well , it ’s a funny old world . ”
43715	43724	43726	43726	Valancy	83	“ Do you think it really is old ? ”
43729	43757	43726	43726	Valancy	83	“ I never believethatin June . It seems so young tonight — somehow . In that quivering moonlight — like a young , white girl — waiting . ”
43758	43774	43776	43776	Barney	132	“ Moonlight here on the verge of up back is different from moonlight anywhere else , ”
43778	43806	43776	43776	Barney	132	“ It always makes me feel so clean , somehow — body and soul . And of course the age of gold always comes back in spring . ”
43852	43857	43858	43858	he	1224	“ Put that on , ”
43861	43869	43871	43871	Valancy	83	“ Do n’t you want it yourself ? ”
43873	43889	43871	43871	Valancy	83	“ No . I ’m not going to have you catching cold on my hands . ”
43890	43943	43858	43858	he	1224	“ Oh , I wo n’t catch cold . I have n’t had a cold since I came to Mr. Gay’s — though I ’ve done the foolishest things . It ’s funny , too — I used to have them all the time . I feel so selfish taking your coat . ”
43944	43966	43967	43967	He	1224	“ You ’ve sneezed three times . No use winding up your ‘ experience ’ up back with grippe or pneumonia . ”
44025	44029	44030	44030	Barney	132	“ up back . ”
44108	44122	44123	44123	Barney	132	“ Can you let me have enough gas to take me to Deerwood ? ”
44137	44144	44145	44145	he	87	“ Valancy , how came youhere ! ”
44149	44157	44159	44159	Valancy	83	“ By chance or God ’s grace , ”
44161	44174	44176	44177	Uncle Wellington	87	“ With this jail - bird — at ten o’clock at night ! ”
44202	44209	44195	44195	her	132	“ Areyou a jail - bird ? ”
44210	44215	44217	44217	Barney	132	“ Does it matter ? ”
44224	44236	44238	44238	Valancy	83	“ Not to me . I only asked out of curiosity , ”
44240	44253	44254	44254	He	87	“ Then I wo n’t tell you . I never satisfy curiosity . ”
44265	44299	44260	44260	his	87	“ Mr. Stirling , I asked you if you could let me have some gas . If you can , well and good . If not , we are only delaying you unnecessarily . ”
44363	44371	44372	44372	he	87	“ Got anything to get gas in ? ”
44512	44520	44522	44522	Olive	164	“ She got it from the Wansbarras , ”
44525	44537	44522	44522	Olive	164	“ There ’s nothing like that in the Stirlings — nothing ! ”
44538	44548	44549	44549	Cecil	94	“ I hope not — I certainly hope not , ”
44554	44577	44549	44549	Cecil	94	“ But then — to go out as a servant — for that is what it practically amounts to . Your cousin ! ”
44598	44602	44609	44609	She	83	“ worked out . ”
44613	44620	44609	44609	She	83	“ Olive , does it hurt ? ”
44626	44629	44609	44609	She	83	“ Doeswhathurt ? ”
44630	44635	44609	44609	She	83	“ Looking like that . ”
44662	44665	44666	44666	she	83	“ Doss , ”
44673	44684	44666	44666	she	83	“ wo n’t you come home — come home tonight ? ”
44688	44696	44697	44697	she	83	“ You sound like a revival meeting , ”
44700	44705	44697	44697	she	83	“ You really do . ”
44706	44714	44666	44666	she	83	“ If you will come back — — ”
44715	44721	44666	44666	she	83	“ All will be forgiven . ”
44722	44725	44727	44727	Olive	93	“ Yes , ”
44743	44768	44666	44666	she	83	“ We ’ll never cast it up to you . Doss , there are nights when I can not sleep for thinking of you . ”
44769	44779	44781	44781	Valancy	83	“ And me having the time of my life , ”
44785	44807	44781	44781	Valancy	83	“ Doss , I ca n’t believe you ’re bad . I ’ve always said you could n’t be bad — — ”
44808	44817	44819	44819	Valancy	83	“ I do n’t believe I can be , ”
44821	44862	44819	44819	Valancy	83	“ I ’m afraid I ’m hopelessly proper . I ’ve been sitting here for three hours with Barney Snaith and he has n’t even tried to kiss me . I would n’t have minded if he had , Olive . ”
44947	44954	44956	44956	Barney	132	“ Thanks — that ’s enough , ”
44961	44977	44956	44956	Barney	132	“ Much obliged , Mr. Stirling . Two gallons — seventy cents . Thank you . ”
45047	45051	45053	45053	Olive	93	“ Drive on , ”
45056	45075	45053	45053	Olive	93	“ There ’s no use in waiting here . Let me tell you what she said to me . ”
45076	45086	45088	45089	Uncle Wellington	87	“ The little hussy ! The shameless little hussy ! ”
45164	45179	45180	45180	His	1246	“ I ’m going to the Port . Will you go there with me ? ”
45215	45218	45204	45204	she	83	“ hopped in ”
45386	45392	45393	45393	she	83	“ Was it for this , ”
45399	45408	45393	45393	she	83	“ that I suffered the pangs of motherhood ? ”
45409	45415	45417	45418	Cousin Stickles	89	“ I will not believe , ”
45421	45431	45417	45418	Cousin Stickles	89	“ that our prayers will not yet be answered . ”
45432	45445	45447	45448	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Who — whowill protect that unfortunate girl when I am gone ? ”
45945	46093	45929	45929	she	172	“ He was stopping at the hotel across the lake . He used to come over in his canoe at night — we met in the pines down the shore . He was a young college student — his father was a rich man in Toronto . Oh , Valancy , I did n’t mean to be bad — I did n’t , indeed . But I loved him so — I love him yet — I’ll always love him . And I — didn’t know — some things . I didn’t — understand . Then his father came and took him away . And — after a little — I found out — oh , Valancy,—I was so frightened . I did n’t know what to do . I wrote him — and he came . He — he said he would marry me , Valancy . ”
46094	46103	46373	46373	Valancy	83	“ And why — and why ? — — ”
46104	46170	45929	45929	she	172	“ Oh , Valancy , he did n’t love me any more . I saw that at a glance . He — he was just offering to marry me because he thought he ought to — because he was sorry for me . He was n’t bad — but he was so young — and what was I that he should keep on loving me ? ”
46171	46179	46181	46181	Valancy	83	“ Never mind making excuses for him , ”
46186	46194	46181	46181	Valancy	83	“ So you would n’t marry him ? ”
46195	46249	45929	45929	she	172	“ I couldn’t — not when he did n’t love me any more . Somehow — I ca n’t explain — it seemed a worse thing to do than — the other . He — he argued a little — but he went away . Do you think I did right , Valancy ? ”
46250	46263	45929	45929	she	172	“ Yes , I do . Youdid right . But he — — ”
46264	46310	46181	46181	Valancy	83	“ Do n’t blame him , dear . Please do n’t . Let ’s not talk about him at all . There ’s no need . I wanted to tell you how it was — I did n’t want you to think me bad — — ”
46311	46318	45929	45929	she	172	“ I never did think so . ”
46319	46365	45929	45929	she	172	“ Yes , I felt that — whenever you came . Oh , Valancy , what you ’ve been to me ! I can never tell you — but God will bless you for it . I know He will—‘with what measure ye mete . ’ ”
46383	46503	46378	46378	she	172	“ Well , that ’s almost all . I came home . I was n’t really so very unhappy . I suppose I should have been — but I was n’t . Father was n’t hard on me . And my baby was so sweet while he lived . I was even happy — I loved him so much , the dear little thing . He was so sweet , Valancy — with such lovely blue eyes — and little rings of pale gold hair like silk floss — and tiny dimpled hands . I used to bite his satin - smooth little face all over — softly , so as not to hurt him , you know — — ”
46504	46508	46510	46510	Valancy	83	“ I know , ”
46514	46525	46510	46510	Valancy	83	“ I know — a womanalwaysknows — and dreams — — ”
46526	46650	46378	46378	she	172	“ And he wasallmine . Nobody else had any claim on him . When he died , oh , Valancy , I thought I must die too — I did n’t see how anybody could endure such anguish and live . To see his dear little eyes and know he would never open them again — to miss his warm little body nestled against mine at night and think of him sleeping alone and cold , his wee face under the hard frozen earth . It was so awful for the first year — after that it was a little easier , one did n’t keep thinking ‘ this day last year’—but I was so glad when I found out I was dying . ”
46651	46668	46670	46670	Valancy	83	“ ‘ Who could endure life if it were not for the hope of death ? ’ ”
46687	46699	46701	46701	Cissy	172	“ I ’m glad I ’ve told you all about it , ”
46703	46710	46701	46701	Cissy	172	“ I wanted you to know . ”
46751	46833	46745	46745	Cissy	172	“ Valancy , why should you ? He can do nothing for me . I ’ve known for several days that — this — was near . Let me die in peace , dear — just holding your hand . Oh , I ’m so glad you ’re here . Tell Father good - bye for me . He ’s always been as good to me as he knew how — and Barney . Somehow , I think that Barney — — ”
47140	47147	47148	47148	he	133	“ Cissy dead — Cissy dead , ”
47152	47203	47148	47148	he	133	“ I did n’t think it would ‘ a ’ come so soon . Dead . She used to run down the lane to meet me with a little white rose stuck in her hair . Cissy used to be a pretty little girl . And a good little girl . ”
47204	47214	47216	47216	Valancy	83	“ She has always been a good little girl , ”
47300	47303	47269	47269	he	1279	“ up back ”

48110	48114	48115	48115	she	91	“ My child , ”
48119	48125	48115	48115	she	91	“ you ’ll come homenow ? ”
48126	48129	48131	48131	Valancy	83	“ Home , ”

48193	48198	48200	48201	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Yes , home , ”
48209	48225	48200	48201	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ I suppose you wo n’t dream of staying herenow — alone with Roaring Abel . ”
48226	48238	48240	48240	Valancy	83	“ Oh , no , I ’m not going to stayhere , ”
48242	48290	48240	48240	Valancy	83	“ Of course , I ’ll have to stay for a day or two , to put the house in order generally . But that will be all . Excuse me , Mother , wo n’t you ? I ’ve a frightful lot to do — all those “
48293	48301	48302	48303	Mrs. Frederick	91	” people will be here to supper . ”
48318	48334	48336	48337	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ We will just treat her as if nothing had happened when she comes back , ”
48339	48354	48336	48337	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ That will be the best plan . Just as if nothing had happened . ”
48416	48419	48403	48404	Roaring Abel	133	“ up back ”
48454	48562	48445	48445	Abel	133	“ She wo n’t be like you , my girl . Well , I ’m obliged to you . You helped me out of a bad hole and I wo n’t forget it . And I wo n’t forget what you did for Cissy . I ’m your friend , and if you ever want any of the Stirlings spanked and sot in a corner send for me . I ’m going to wet my whistle . Lord , but I ’m dry ! Do n’t reckon I ’ll be back afore tomorrow night , so if you ’re going home tomorrow , good - bye now . ”
48563	48568	48570	48570	Valancy	83	“ Imaygo home tomorrow , ”
48572	48582	48570	48570	Valancy	83	“ but I ’m not going back to Deerwood . ”
48583	48588	48445	48445	Abel	133	“ Not going — — ”
48589	48600	48602	48602	Valancy	83	“ You ’ll find the key on the woodshed nail , ”
48608	48665	48602	48602	Valancy	83	“ The dog will be in the barn and the cat in the cellar . Do n’t forget to feed her till your cousin comes . The pantry is full and I made bread and pies today . Good - bye , Mr. Gay . You have been very kind to me and I appreciate it . ”
48666	48686	48688	48689	Roaring Abel	133	“ We ’ve had a d —— d decent time of it together , and that ’s a fact , ”
48691	48723	48688	48689	Roaring Abel	133	“ You ’re the best small sport in the world , and your little finger is worth the whole Stirling clan tied together . Good - bye and good - luck . ”
48868	48875	48851	48851	he	1328	“ Going home , Miss Stirling ? ”
48876	48884	48886	48886	Valancy	83	“ I do n’t know — yet , ”
48908	48927	48929	48929	Barney	132	“ I thought I ’d run down and ask if there was anything I could do for you , ”
48938	48950	48951	48951	she	83	“ Yes , there is something you can do for me , ”
48958	48964	48951	48951	she	83	“ Will you marry me ? ”
48988	49015	48982	48982	he	1328	“ Come , now ! I knew luck was just waiting around the corner for me . All the signs have been pointing that way today . ”
49016	49019	49020	49020	Valancy	83	“ Wait . ”
49025	49069	49020	49020	Valancy	83	“ I ’m in earnest — but I want to get my breath after that question . Of course , with my bringing up , I realise perfectly well that this is one of the things ‘ a lady should not do . ’ ”
49070	49076	49091	49091	she	83	“ But why — why ? ”
49077	49082	49083	49083	Valancy	83	“ For two reasons . ”
49135	49143	49156	49156	She	83	“ The first reason is , I — I”—Valancy
49147	49151	49156	49156	She	83	“ I love you ”
49166	49179	49180	49180	She	83	“ I ’m crazy about you . The second is — this . ”
49227	49238	49216	49216	He	1334	“ Are you sure nothing can be done for you ? ”
49246	49299	49239	49239	Valancy	83	“ Yes . You know Dr. Trent ’s reputation in regard to heart disease . I have n’t long to live — perhaps only a few months — a few weeks . I want tolivethem . I ca n’t go back to Deerwood — you know what my life was like there . And”—she
49303	49323	49324	49324	Barney	132	time—“I love you . I want to spend the rest of my life with you . That ’s all . ”
49354	49370	49324	49324	Barney	132	“ You do n’t know anything about me . I may be a — murderer . ”
49371	49399	49422	49422	her	1336	“ No , I do n’t . Youmaybe something dreadful . Everything they say of you may be true . But it does n’t matter to me . ”
49400	49410	49412	49412	Barney	132	“ You care that much for me , Valancy ? ”
49431	49438	49440	49440	Valancy	83	“ I care — that much , ”
49483	49492	49494	49494	Barney	132	“ If we are going to get married , ”
49509	49516	49494	49494	Barney	132	“ some things must be understood . ”
49517	49523	49525	49525	Valancy	83	“ Everything must be understood , ”
49527	49536	49538	49538	Barney	132	“ I have things I want to hide , ”
49541	49551	49538	49538	Barney	132	“ You are not to ask me about them . ”
49552	49557	49559	49559	Valancy	83	“ I wo n’t , ”
49561	49571	49559	49559	Valancy	83	“ You must never ask to see my mail . ”
49572	49575	49538	49538	Barney	132	“ Never . ”
49576	49588	49538	49538	Barney	132	“ And we are never to pretend anything to each other . ”
49589	49594	49596	49596	Valancy	83	“ We wo n’t , ”
49598	49625	49538	49538	Barney	132	“ You wo n’t even have to pretend you like me . If you marry me I know you ’re only doing it out of pity . ”
49626	49648	49538	49538	Barney	132	“ And we ’ll never tell a lie to each other about anything — a big lie or a petty lie . ”
49649	49655	49657	49657	Valancy	83	“ Especially a petty lie , ”
49659	49678	49657	49657	Valancy	83	“ And you ’ll have to live back on my island . I wo n’t live anywhere else . ”
49679	49690	49692	49692	Valancy	83	“ That ’s partly why I want to marry you , ”
49699	49715	49694	49694	Barney	132	“ I believe you mean it . Well — let ’s get married , then . ”
49716	49720	49722	49722	Valancy	83	“ Thank you , ”
49744	49843	49694	49694	Barney	132	“ I suppose I have n’t any right to make conditions . But I ’m going to make one . You are never to refer to my heart or my liability to sudden death . You are never to urge me to be careful . You are to forget — absolutely forget — that I ’m not perfectly healthy . I have written a letter to my mother — here it is — you are to keep it . I have explained everything in it . If I drop dead suddenly — as I likely will do — — ”
49844	49863	49865	49865	Barney	132	“ It will exonerate me in the eyes of your kindred from the suspicion of having poisoned you , ”
49870	49873	49874	49874	Valancy	83	“ Exactly . ”
49878	49935	49874	49874	Valancy	83	“ Dear me , I ’m glad this is over . It has been — a bit of an ordeal . You see , I ’m not in the habit of going about asking men to marry me . It is so nice of you not to refuse me — or offer to be a brother ! ”
49936	49962	49874	49874	Valancy	83	“ I ’ll go to the Port tomorrow and get a license . We can be married tomorrow evening . Dr. Stalling , I suppose ? ”
49963	49968	49969	49969	Valancy	83	“ Heavens , no . ”
49972	50009	49969	49969	Valancy	83	“ Besides , he would n’t do it . He ’d shake his forefinger at me and I ’d jilt you at the altar . No , I want my old Mr. Towers to marry me . ”
50010	50019	50021	50021	Barney	132	“ Will you marry me as I stand ? ”
50055	50058	50059	50059	she	83	“ Yes , ”
50080	50083	50084	50084	he	1341	“ Valancy , ”
50092	50132	50084	50084	he	1341	“ of course I ’m not in love with you — never thought of such a thing as being in love . But , do you know , I ’ve always thought you were a bit of a dear . ”
50277	50280	50282	50282	Barney	132	“ Ready ? ”
50294	50297	50298	50298	Valancy	83	“ Yes . ”
50371	50378	50380	50380	Barney	132	“ Have n’t changed your mind ? ”
50382	50388	50380	50380	Barney	132	“ No . Have you ? ”
50389	50392	50380	50380	Barney	132	“ No . ”
50740	50752	50753	50754	Mr. Towers	219	“ Mrs. Snaith , I hope you will be very happy , ”
50781	50785	50786	50786	He	219	“ up back . ”
50862	50871	50872	50872	Barney	132	“ What a nice way to get married ! ”
50883	50900	50876	50876	he	219	“ No fuss and flub - dub . I never supposed it was half so easy . ”
50901	50907	50909	50909	Valancy	83	“ For heaven ’s sake , ”
50912	50939	50940	50940	Barney	132	“ let ’s forget wearemarried and talk as if we were n’t . I ca n’t stand another drive like the one we had coming in . ”
50953	50965	50966	50966	he	219	“ And I thought I was making it easy for you , ”
50969	50979	50966	50966	he	219	“ You did n’t seem to want to talk . ”
50980	51031	50876	50876	he	219	“ I did n’t . But I wanted you to talk . I do n’t want you to make love to me , but I want you to act like an ordinary human being . Tell me about this island of yours . What sort of a place is it ? ”
51032	51198	50940	50940	Barney	132	“ The jolliest place in the world . You ’re going to love it . The first time I saw it I loved it . Old Tom MacMurray owned it then . He built the little shack on it , lived there in winter and rented it to Toronto people in summer . I bought it from him — became by that one simple transaction a landed proprietor owning a house and an island . There is something so satisfying in owning a whole island . And is n’t an uninhabited island a charming idea ? I ’d wanted to own one ever since I ’d readRobinson Crusoe . It seemed too good to be true . And beauty ! Most of the scenery belongs to the government , but they do n’t tax you for looking at it , and the moon belongs to everybody . You wo n’t find my shack very tidy . I suppose you ’ll want to make it tidy . ”
51199	51202	51204	51204	Valancy	83	“ Yes , ”
51207	51234	51204	51204	Valancy	83	“ Ihaveto be tidy . I do n’t reallywantto be . But untidiness hurts me . Yes , I ’ll have to tidy up your shack . ”
51235	51242	51244	51244	Barney	132	“ I was prepared for that , ”
51251	51254	51256	51256	Valancy	83	“ But , ”
51259	51274	51256	51256	Valancy	83	“ I wo n’t insist on your wiping your feet when you come in . ”
51275	51292	51294	51294	Barney	132	“ No , you ’ll only sweep up after me with the air of a martyr , ”
51296	51329	51294	51294	Barney	132	“ Well , anyway , you ca n’t tidy the lean - to . You ca n’t even enter it . The door will be locked and I shall keep the key . ”
51330	51335	51337	51337	Valancy	83	“ Bluebeard ’s chamber , ”
51339	51370	51337	51337	Valancy	83	“ I sha n’t even think of it . I do n’t care how many wives you have hanging up in it . So long as they ’re really dead . ”
51371	51591	51294	51294	Barney	132	“ Dead as door - nails . You can do as you like in the rest of the house . There ’s not much of it — just one big living - room and one small bedroom . Well built , though . Old Tom loved his job . The beams of our house are cedar and the rafters fir . Our living - room windows face west and east . It ’s wonderful to have a room where you can see both sunrise and sunset . I have two cats there . Banjo and Good Luck . Adorable animals . Banjo is a big , enchanting , grey devil - cat . Striped , of course . I do n’t care a hang for any cat that has n’t stripes . I never knew a cat who could swear as genteelly and effectively as Banjo . His only fault is that he snores horribly when he is asleep . Luck is a dainty little cat . Always looking wistfully at you , as if he wanted to tell you something . Maybe he will pull it off sometime . Once in a thousand years , you know , one cat is allowed to speak . My cats are philosophers — neither of them ever cries over spilt milk . “
51667	51668	51680	51687	Nice , queer , uncanny , mysterious creatures	1368	” “
51675	51676	51671	51671	I	0	” “
51734	51735	51731	51732	Lady Jane	204	” “
51750	51772	51747	51747	your	0	” admitted Valancy . Barney laughed — the laugh Valancy did not like — the little , bitter , cynical laugh . “
51779	51878	51773	51773	I	0	” he said shortly . They went back through Deerwood . Up the Muskoka road . Past Roaring Abel ’s . Over the rocky , daisied lane . The dark pine woods swallowed them up . Through the pine woods , where the air was sweet with the incense of the unseen , fragile bells of the linnæas that carpeted the banks of the trail . Out to the shore of Mistawis . Lady Jane must be left here . They got out . Barney led the way down a little path to the edge of the lake . “
51884	51972	51973	51973	My	0	” he said gloatingly . Valancy looked — and looked — and looked again . There was a diaphanous , lilac mist on the lake , shrouding the island . Through it the two enormous pine - trees that clasped hands over Barney ’s shack loomed out like dark turrets . Behind them was a sky still rose - hued in the afterlight , and a pale young moon . Valancy shivered like a tree the wind stirs suddenly . Something seemed to sweep over her soul . “
51977	51981	51973	51973	My	0	” she said . “
51988	52077	51973	51973	My	0	” They got into the canoe and paddled out to it . They left behind the realm of everyday and things known and landed on a realm of mystery and enchantment where anything might happen — anything might be true . Barney lifted Valancy out of the canoe and swung her to a lichen - covered rock under a young pine - tree . His arms were about her and suddenly his lips were on hers . Valancy found herself shivering with the rapture of her first kiss . “
52083	52087	52081	52081	dear	2074	” Barney was saying .
52429	52440	52445	52445	she	102	“ I suppose you ’re going home , dear Doss ? ”
52463	52468	52470	52470	Valancy	83	“ Sooner or later , ”
52473	52502	52470	52470	Valancy	83	“ Then I ’ll go along with you . I ’ve been wanting to see you very especially , Doss dear . I ’ve something quitewonderfulto tell you . ”
52503	52506	52508	52508	Valancy	83	“ Yes ? ”
52544	52557	52559	52560	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Who do you suppose called to see me the other day ? ”
52568	52572	52563	52563	Valancy	83	“ Edward Beck . ”
52583	52587	52576	52576	her	102	“ Edward Beck . ”
52596	52604	52606	52606	Valancy	83	“ Who on earth is Edward Beck ? ”
52613	52620	52621	52621	she	102	“ Surely you remember Edward Beck , ”
52625	52649	52621	52621	she	102	“ He lives in that lovely house on the Port Lawrence road and he comes to our church — regularly . Youmustremember him . ”
52650	52659	52661	52661	Valancy	83	“ Oh , I think I do now , ”
52669	52700	52661	52661	Valancy	83	“ He ’s that old man with a wen on his forehead and dozens of children , who always sits in the pew by the door , is n’t he ? ”
52701	52763	52772	52772	Valancy	83	“ Not dozens of children , dear — oh , no , not dozens . Not evenonedozen . Only nine . At least only nine that count . The rest are dead . He is n’t old — he ’s only about forty - eight — the prime of life , Doss — and what does it matter about a wen ? ”
52764	52770	52772	52772	Valancy	83	“ Nothing , of course , ”
52872	52876	52878	52879	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ My dear , ”
52881	52888	52878	52879	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Edward Beck wants to marryyou . ”
52915	52918	52911	52911	she	83	“ Me ? ”
52919	52989	52878	52879	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Yes , you . He fell in love with you at the funeral . And he came to consult me about it . I was such a friend of his first wife , you know . He is very much in earnest , Dossie . And it ’s a wonderful chance for you . He ’s very well off — and you know — you — you — — ”
52990	53000	53002	53002	Valancy	83	“ Am not so young as I once was , ”
53004	53029	53002	53002	Valancy	83	“ ‘ To her that hath shall be given . ’ Do you really think I would make a good stepmother , Cousin Georgiana ? ”
53030	53045	52878	52879	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ I ’m sure you would . You were always so fond of children . ”
53046	53057	53059	53059	Valancy	83	“ But nine is such a family to start with , ”
53062	53151	53059	53059	Valancy	83	“ The two oldest are grown up and the third almost . That leaves only six that really count . And most of them are boys . So much easier to bring up than girls . There ’s an excellent book—‘Health Care of the Growing Child’—Gladys has a copy , I think . It would be such a help to you . And there are books about morals . You ’d manage nicely . Of course I told Mr. Beck that I thought you would — would — — ”
53152	53157	53159	53159	Valancy	83	“ Jump at him , ”
53161	53201	53159	53159	Valancy	83	“ Oh , no , no , dear . I would n’t use such an indelicate expression . I told him I thought you would consider his proposal favourably . And you will , wo n’t you , dearie ? ”
53202	53209	53211	53211	Valancy	83	“ There ’s only one obstacle , ”
53214	53223	53211	53211	Valancy	83	“ You see , I ’m married already . ”
53224	53227	53228	53229	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Married ! ”
53239	53242	53237	53237	Valancy	83	“ Married ! ”
53243	53259	53211	53211	Valancy	83	“ Yes . I was married to Barney Snaith last Tuesday evening in Port Lawrence . ”
53278	53297	53270	53271	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Doss , dear — I’m an old woman — are you trying to make fun of me ? ”
53298	53317	53211	53211	Valancy	83	“ Not at all . I ’m only telling you the truth . For heaven ’s sake , Cousin Georgiana,”—Valancy
53322	53331	53237	53237	Valancy	83	symptoms—“don’t go crying here on the public road ! ”
53347	53359	53332	53333	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Oh , Doss , whathave you done ? Whathaveyou done ? ”
53360	53373	53375	53375	Valancy	83	“ I ’ve just been telling you . I ’ve got married , ”
53381	53406	53375	53375	Valancy	83	“ To that — that — aw — that — Barney Snaith . Why , they say he ’s had a dozen wives already . ”
53407	53417	53419	53419	Valancy	83	“ I ’m the only one round at present , ”
53421	53429	53419	53419	Valancy	83	“ What will your poor mother say ? ”
53434	53448	53450	53450	Valancy	83	“ Come along with me and hear , if you want to know , ”
53452	53463	53450	53450	Valancy	83	“ I ’m on my way to tell her now . ”
53589	53599	53601	53602	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ To marry a man you know nothing about , ”
53605	53618	53620	53620	Valancy	83	“ I know more about him than I know of Edward Beck , ”
53622	53628	53630	53631	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Edward Beckgoes to church , ”
53633	53641	53630	53631	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Does Bar — does your husband ? ”
53642	53656	53658	53658	Valancy	83	“ He has promised that he will go with me on fine Sundays , ”
53675	53687	53630	53631	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Look at my rosebush ! Why , it ’s blooming ! ”
53708	53720	53722	53722	Valancy	83	“ My cutting it to pieces must have done it good , ”
53827	53830	53832	53832	Valancy	83	“ Beautiful , ”
53835	53836	53838	53838	she	93	“ but”—as
53845	53852	53838	53838	she	93	eyes—“without the slightest touch of distinction . ”
53946	53967	53939	53939	She	93	“ So you ’re back , Doss ? Very warm day , is n’t it ? Did you walk in ? ”
53968	53974	53939	53939	She	93	“ Yes . Coming in ? ”
53975	54058	53939	53939	She	93	“ Oh , no . I ’ve just been in . I ’ve come often to comfort poor Aunty . She ’s been so lonesome . I ’m going to Mrs. Bartlett ’s tea . I have to help pour . She ’s giving it for her cousin from Toronto . Such a charming girl . You ’d have loved meeting her , Doss . I think Mrs. Bartlett did send you a card . Perhaps you ’ll drop in later on . ”
54059	54068	54070	54070	Valancy	83	“ No , I do n’t think so , ”
54073	54098	54070	54070	Valancy	83	“ I ’ll have to be home to get Barney ’s supper . We ’re going for a moonlit canoe ride around Mistawis tonight . ”
54099	54104	54106	54106	Olive	93	“ Barney ? Supper ? ”
54108	54115	54106	54106	Olive	93	“ Whatdoyou mean , Valancy Stirling ? ”
54116	54126	54127	54127	Valancy	83	“ Valancy Snaith , by the grace of God . ”
54339	54349	54350	54351	Uncle Benjamin	100	answer—“one gets all the honey , the other all the whacks”—and
54490	54495	54496	54496	she	83	“ Well , Mother , ”
54500	54509	54511	54512	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ So you ’ve come home at last ! ”
54537	54543	54545	54545	Valancy	83	“ Well , not exactly , ”
54552	54575	54547	54547	She	83	“ I thought I ought to drop in and tell you I was married . Last Tuesday night . To Barney Snaith . ”
54585	54591	54592	54592	he	100	“ God bless my soul ! ”
54625	54636	54638	54638	Valancy	83	“ She would have to keep up the Victorian traditions , ”
54661	54673	54675	54675	Valancy	83	“ Is thereoneday in your life that you have n’t cried ? ”
54678	54681	54683	54684	Uncle James	99	“ Valancy , ”
54696	54706	54683	54684	Uncle James	99	“ did you mean what you said just now ? ”
54707	54711	54675	54675	Valancy	83	“ I did . ”
54712	54742	54683	54684	Uncle James	99	“ Do you mean to say that you have actually gone and married — married — that notorious Barney Snaith — that — that — criminal — that — — ”
54743	54747	54683	54684	Uncle James	99	“ I have . ”
54748	54751	54753	54754	Uncle James	99	“ Then , ”
54757	54793	54753	54754	Uncle James	99	“ you are a shameless creature , lost to all sense of propriety and virtue , and I wash my hands entirely of you . I do not want ever to see your face again . ”
54794	54806	54808	54808	Valancy	83	“ What have you left to say when I commit murder ? ”
54821	54829	54810	54811	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ That drunken outlaw — that — — ”
54856	54867	54868	54868	she	83	“ Say ‘ damn ’ and you ’ll feel better , ”
54871	54898	54868	54868	she	83	“ I can express my feelings without blasphemy . And I tell you have covered yourself with eternal disgrace and infamy by marrying that drunkard — — ”
54899	54914	54835	54835	Valancy	83	“ Youwould be more endurable if you got drunk occasionally . Barney isnota drunkard . ”
54915	54929	54931	54932	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ He was seen drunk in Port Lawrence — pickled to the gills , ”
54934	54985	54931	54932	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ If that is true — and I do n’t believe it — he had a good reason for it . Now I suggest that you all stop looking tragic and accept the situation . I ’m married — you ca n’t undo that . And I ’m perfectly happy . ”
54986	55000	55002	55003	Cousin Sarah	158	“ I suppose we ought to be thankful he has really married her , ”
55016	55022	55024	55025	Uncle James	99	“ If he really has , ”
55036	55041	55024	55025	Uncle James	99	“ Who married you ? ”
55042	55050	55085	55085	she	91	“ Mr. Towers , of Port Lawrence . ”
55051	55057	55059	55060	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ By a Free Methodist ! ”
55124	55137	55139	55140	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ It makes me think of those what - d’ye - call-’ems , ”
55143	55159	55139	55140	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Those yarns — you know — of fairies taking babies out of their cradles . ”
55160	55172	55174	55175	Aunt Wellington	84	“ Valancy could hardly be a changeling at twenty - nine , ”
55178	55192	55194	55195	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ She was the oddest - looking baby I ever saw , anyway , ”
55197	55223	55194	55195	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ I said so at the time — you remember , Amelia ? I said I had never seen such eyes in a human head . ”
55224	55232	55234	55235	Cousin Sarah	158	“ I ’m gladInever had any children , ”
55237	55254	55234	55235	Cousin Sarah	158	“ If they do n’t break your heart in one way they do it in another . ”
55255	55272	55274	55274	Valancy	83	“ Is n’t it better to have your heart broken than to have it wither up ? ”
55276	55295	55274	55274	Valancy	83	“ Before it could be broken it must have felt something splendid . Thatwould be worth the pain . ”
55296	55302	55304	55305	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Dippy — clean dippy , ”
55322	55325	55327	55328	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Valancy , ”
55331	55344	55327	55328	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ do you ever pray to be forgiven for disobeying your mother ? ”
55345	55356	55358	55358	Valancy	83	“ Ishouldpray to be forgiven for obeying you so long , ”
55361	55382	55358	55358	Valancy	83	“ But I do n’t pray about that at all . I just thank God every day for my happiness . ”
55383	55388	55390	55391	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ I would rather , ”
55399	55415	55390	55391	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ see you dead before me than listen to what you have told me today . ”
55460	55474	55476	55477	Uncle James	99	“ Barney Snaith is a scoundrel to have deluded you into marrying him , ”
55480	55492	55494	55494	Valancy	83	“ Oh , Idid the deluding . I askedhimto marry me , ”
55501	55505	55507	55508	Aunt Wellington	84	“ Have younopride ? ”
55510	55541	55507	55508	Aunt Wellington	84	“ Lots of it . I am proud that I have achieved a husband by my own unaided efforts . Cousin Georgiana here wanted to help me to Edward Beck . ”
55542	55561	55563	55564	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Edward Beck is worth twenty thousand dollars and has the finest house between here and Port Lawrence , ”
55566	55572	55574	55574	Valancy	83	“ That sounds very fine , ”
55577	55582	55574	55574	Valancy	83	“ but it is n’t worththat“—she
55585	55599	55507	55508	Aunt Wellington	84	fingers—“compared to feeling Barney ’s arms around me and his cheek against mine . ”
55600	55605	55607	55608	Cousin Stickles	89	“ Oh , Doss ! ”
55614	55619	55610	55611	Cousin Sarah	158	“ Oh , Doss ! ”
55624	55633	55620	55621	Aunt Wellington	84	“ Valancy , you need not be indecent . ”
55634	55666	55507	55508	Aunt Wellington	84	“ Why , it surely is n’t indecent to like to have your husband put his arm around you ? I should think it would be indecent if you did n’t . ”
55667	55674	55676	55677	Uncle James	99	“ Why expect decency from her ? ”
55680	55702	55676	55677	Uncle James	99	“ She has cut herself off from decency forevermore . She has made her bed . Let her lie on it . ”
55703	55706	55708	55708	Valancy	83	“ Thanks , ”
55712	55744	55708	55708	Valancy	83	“ How you would have enjoyed being Torquemada ! Now , I must really be getting back . Mother , may I have those three woollen cushions I worked last winter ? ”
55745	55752	55754	55755	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Take them — take everything ! ”
55757	55794	55754	55755	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Oh , I do n’t want everything — or much . I do n’t want my Blue Castle cluttered . Just the cushions . I ’ll call for them some day when we motor in . ”
55827	55841	55842	55842	she	83	“ The trouble with you people is that you do n’t laugh enough , ”
55845	55850	55852	55853	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Doss , dear , ”
55856	55869	55852	55853	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ some day you will discover that blood is thicker than water . ”
55870	55884	55886	55886	Valancy	83	“ Of course it is . But who wants water to be thick ? ”
55888	55902	55903	55904	Cousin Stickles	89	“ We want water to be thin — sparkling — crystal - clear . ”
55932	55950	55929	55929	she	83	“ Do you mind if I drop in and see you once in a while , Mother ? ”
55951	55961	55963	55964	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ My house will always be open to you , ”
55971	55979	55981	55982	Uncle James	99	“ You should never recognise her again , ”
55992	56004	56006	56007	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ I can not quite forget that I am a mother , ”
56009	56016	56006	56007	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ My poor , unfortunate girl ! ”
56017	56027	56029	56030	Uncle James	99	“ I dare say the marriage is n’t legal , ”
56033	56066	56067	56067	James	99	“ He has probably been married half a dozen times before . ButIam through with her . I have done all I could , Amelia . I think you will admit that . Henceforth”—Uncle
56072	56080	56067	56067	James	99	it—“Valancy is to me as one dead . ”
56081	56086	56088	56089	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Mrs. Barney Snaith , ”
56103	56114	56116	56117	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ He has a score of aliases , no doubt , ”
56119	56144	56116	56117	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ For my part , I believe the man is half Indian . I have n’t a doubt they ’re living in a wigwam . ”
56145	56173	56175	56176	Cousin Stickles	89	“ If he has married her under the name of Snaith and it is n’t his real name would n’t that make the marriage null and void ? ”
56185	56199	56179	56180	Uncle James	99	“ No , it is the man who marries , not the name . ”
56200	56204	56206	56207	Cousin Gladys	105	“ You know , ”
56219	56271	56206	56207	Cousin Gladys	105	“ I had a distinct premonition of this at Herbert ’s silver dinner . I remarked it at the time . When she was defending Snaith . You remember , of course . It came over me like a revelation . I spoke to David when I went home about it . ”
56272	56277	56279	56280	Aunt Wellington	84	“ What — what , ”
56285	56291	56279	56280	Aunt Wellington	84	“ has come over Valancy?Valancy ! ”
56302	56347	56298	56299	Uncle James	99	“ Is n’t there something coming up of late about secondary personalities cropping out ? I do n’t hold with many of those new - fangled notions , but there may be something in this one . It would account for her incomprehensible conduct . ”
56348	56356	56358	56359	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Valancy is so fond of mushrooms , ”
56361	56380	56358	56359	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ I ’m afraid she ’ll get poisoned eating toadstools by mistake living up back in the woods . ”
56381	56389	56391	56392	Uncle James	99	“ There are worse things than death , ”
56412	56421	56423	56424	Cousin Stickles	89	“ Nothing can ever be the same again ! ”
56639	56646	56647	56647	he	100	“ I have made her happy , ”
56651	56665	56647	56647	he	100	“ and she was miserable with her friends . So that ’s that . ”
56687	56691	56699	56699	he	100	“ made happy . ”
56692	56698	56699	56699	he	100	“ You — you pup ! ”
56702	56708	56710	56710	Barney	132	“ Why be so unoriginal ? ”
56713	56760	56710	56710	Barney	132	“ Anybody could call me a pup . Why not think of something worthy of the Stirlings ? Besides , I ’m not a pup . I ’m really quite a middle - aged dog . Thirty - five , if you ’re interested in knowing . ”
56893	56905	56907	56907	Barney	132	“ Peace , perfect peace , with loved ones far away , ”
56938	56948	56949	56949	she	102	“ For your spare - room bed , dear , ”
56952	56963	56965	56965	Valancy	83	“ But I have n’t got any spare - room , ”
56984	56992	56994	56994	Valancy	83	“ But it ’s a lovely spread , ”
57000	57030	56994	56994	Valancy	83	“ and I ’m so glad to have it . I ’ll put it on my own bed . Barney ’s old patch - work quilt is getting ragged . ”
57031	57046	57048	57049	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ I do n’t see how you can be contented to live up back , ”
57051	57060	57048	57049	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ It ’s so out of the world . ”
57061	57064	57065	57065	Valancy	83	“ Contented ! ”
57080	57084	57085	57085	she	102	“ It is , ”
57088	57098	57085	57085	she	102	“ most gloriously and entirely out of the world . ”
57099	57108	57110	57111	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ And you are really happy , dear ? ”
57114	57119	57121	57121	Valancy	83	“ I really am , ”
57128	57136	57138	57139	Cousin Georgiana	102	“ Marriage is such a serious thing , ”
57141	57150	57152	57152	Valancy	83	“ When it ’s going to last long , ”
57237	57240	57226	57226	Barney	132	“ up back ”
58043	58057	58058	58058	Barney	132	“ What a view old Tom picked out when he built this shack ! ”
58222	58226	58227	58227	he	1479	“ After all , ”
58230	58280	58227	58227	he	1479	“ there ’s something to be said for square meals . I ’ve mostly got along by boiling two or three dozen eggs hard at once and eating a few when I got hungry , with a slice of bacon once in a while and a jorum of tea . ”
58624	58635	58636	58636	Barney	132	“ Would you like a house like that , Moonlight ? ”
58659	58662	58664	58664	Valancy	83	“ No , ”
58683	58685	58664	58664	Valancy	83	“ cottage ”
58695	58778	58664	58664	Valancy	83	“ No . It ’s too elegant . I would have to carry it with me everywhere I went . On my back like a snail . It would own me — possess me , body and soul . I like a house I can love and cuddle and boss . Just like ours here . I do n’t envy Hamilton Gossard ‘ the finest summer residence in Canada . ’ It is magnificent , but it is n’t my Blue Castle . ”
58903	58917	58919	58919	Valancy	83	“ It was lovely — but I do n’t want to go again , ”
59125	59133	59134	59134	Barney	132	“ Have you missed me , Moonlight ? ”
59138	59149	59151	59151	Valancy	83	“ It seems a hundred years since you went away , ”
59153	59161	59151	59151	Valancy	83	“ I wo n’t leave you again . ”
59162	59166	59168	59168	Valancy	83	“ You must , ”
59170	59203	59204	59204	Barney	132	“ if you want to . I ’d be miserable if I thought you wanted to go and did n’t , because of me . I want you to feel perfectly free . ”
59211	59222	59223	59223	he	1517	“ There is no such thing as freedom on earth , ”
59226	59265	59223	59223	he	1517	“ Only different kinds of bondages . And comparative bondages . Youthink you are free now because you ’ve escaped from a peculiarly unbearable kind of bondage . But are you ? You love me — that’sa bondage . ”
59266	59285	59287	59287	Valancy	83	“ Who said or wrote that ‘ the prison unto which we doom ourselves no prison is ’ ? ”
59302	59310	59312	59312	Barney	132	“ Ah , now you have it , ”
59314	59334	59312	59312	Barney	132	“ That ’s all the freedom we can hope for — the freedom to choose our prison . But , Moonlight,”—he
59364	59413	59312	59312	Barney	132	lights—“Moonlight , I ’m glad to be home again . When I came down through the woods and saw my home lights — mine — gleaming out under the old pines — something I ’d never seen before — oh , girl , I was glad — glad ! ”
60142	60160	60161	60161	Barney	132	“ We do n’t know where we ’re going , but is n’t it fun to go ? ”
60475	60630	60469	60469	Barney	132	“ Moonlight and blue twilight — that is what you look like in that dress . I like it . It belongs to you . You are n’t exactly pretty , but you have some adorable beauty - spots . Your eyes . And that little kissable dent just between your collar bones . You have the wrist and ankle of an aristocrat . That little head of yours is beautifully shaped . And when you look backward over your shoulder you ’re maddening — especially in twilight or moonlight . An elf maiden . A wood sprite . You belong to the woods , Moonlight — you should never be out of them . In spite of your ancestry , there is something wild and remote and untamed about you . And you have such a nice , sweet , throaty , summery voice . Such a nice voice for love - making . ”
60631	60641	60643	60643	Valancy	83	“ Shure an ’ ye’ve kissed the Blarney Stone , ”
60789	60801	60802	60802	she	83	“ I understand now what it means to be born again , ”
60810	60813	60802	60802	she	83	“ staining backward ”
60858	60868	60870	60870	Valancy	83	“ When death comes , I shall have lived , ”
60872	60880	60870	60870	Valancy	83	“ I shall have had my hour . ”
60916	60922	60923	60923	Barney	132	“ What are you celebrating ? ”
60928	60937	60938	60938	Valancy	83	“ I ’m just exorcising an old demon , ”
61174	61180	61155	61197	those aggravating people who can never hear you smiling audibly over something you ’ve read without inquiring placidly , “ What is the joke ? ” October — with a gorgeous pageant of color around Mistawis , into which Valancy plunged her soul	1572	“ What is the joke ? ”
61464	61484	61486	61486	Barney	132	“ Warm fire — books — comfort — safety from storm — our cats on the rug . Moonlight , ”
61488	61502	61486	61486	Barney	132	“ would you be any happier now if you had a million dollars ? ”
61503	61521	61486	61486	Barney	132	“ No — nor half so happy . I ’d be bored by conventions and obligations then . ”
61640	61642	61604	61605	Her mother	343	“ up back”—almost
61886	61896	61897	61897	he	1592	“ Bring no more of that devilish stuff here , ”
62037	62041	62043	62043	Barney	132	“ Come away , ”
62047	62059	62043	62043	Barney	132	“ We must not commit the desecration of tramping through there . ”
62216	62233	62235	62235	Barney	132	“ ‘ All the beauty that old Greece and Rome , sung painted , taught , ’ ”
62237	62253	62235	62235	Barney	132	“ And to think no human eyes save ours have seen or will see it , ”
62310	62325	62327	62327	Valancy	83	“ ‘ All the tintings of winter woods are extremely delicate and elusive , ’ ”
62329	62517	62327	62327	Valancy	83	“ ‘ When the brief afternoon wanes and the sun just touches the tops of the hills , there seems to be all over the woods an abundance , not of colour , but of the spirit of colour . There is really nothing but pure white after all , but one has the impression of fairy - like blendings of rose and violet , opal and heliotrope on the slopes — in the dingles and along the curves of the forest - land . You feel sure the tint is there , but when you look at it directly it is gone . From the corner of your eye you are aware that it is lurking over yonder in a spot where there was nothing but pale purity a moment ago . Only just when the sun is setting is there a fleeting moment of real colour . Then the redness streams out over the snow and incarnadines the hills and rivers and smites the crest of the pines with flame . Just a few minutes of transfiguration and revelation — and it is gone . ’ “
62530	62534	62521	62522	John Foster	106	” said Valancy . “
62538	62542	62521	62522	John Foster	106	” scoffed Barney . “
62562	62563	62564	62564	You	0	” “
62572	62577	62564	62564	You	0	” said Valancy severely . “
62603	62604	62599	62599	he	106	” “
62612	62617	62605	62605	I	0	” said Barney morosely . “
62627	62628	62620	62620	I	0	” “
62639	62656	62630	62630	you	0	” persisted Valancy . She made him stand still on his snowshoes while she repeated it . “
62671	62677	62658	62658	She	1610	“ for the joy of working ”
62776	62777	62778	62779	Good Lord	277	” “
62792	62803	62804	62805	John Foster	106	” was Barney ’s disgusted reaction as he strode off . “
62820	62824	62804	62805	John Foster	106	” averred Valancy . “
62847	63051	62827	62827	Barney	132	” When they came out to the lake they changed from snowshoes to skates and skated home . For a wonder Valancy had learned , when she was a little schoolgirl , to skate on the pond behind the Deerwood school . She never had any skates of her own , but some of the other girls had lent her theirs and she seemed to have a natural knack of it . Uncle Benjamin had once promised her a pair of skates for Christmas , but when Christmas came he had given her rubbers instead . She had never skated since she grew up , but the old trick came back quickly , and glorious were the hours she and Barney spent skimming over the white lakes and past the dark islands where the summer cottages were closed and silent . Tonight they flew down Mistawis before the wind , in an exhilaration that crimsoned Valancy ’s cheeks under her white tam . And at the end was her dear little house , on the island of pines , with a coating of snow on its roof , sparkling in the moonlight . Its windows glinted impishly at her in the stay gleams . “
63064	63122	62827	62827	Barney	132	” said Barney . They had a lovely Christmas . No rush . No scramble . No niggling attempts to make ends meet . No wild effort to remember whether she had n’t given the same kind of present to the same person two Christmases before — no mob of last - minute shoppers — no dreary family “
63124	63135	62827	62827	Barney	132	” where she sat mute and unimportant — no attacks of “
63138	63183	62827	62827	Barney	132	” They decorated the Blue Castle with pine boughs , and Valancy made delightful little tinsel stars and hung them up amid the greenery . She cooked a dinner to which Barney did full justice , while Good Luck and Banjo picked the bones . “
63198	63202	62827	62827	Barney	132	” vowed Barney . “
63206	63230	63231	63231	One	330	” And they drank to the Union Jack a bottle of dandelion wine that Cousin Georgiana had given Valancy along with the bedspread . “
63235	63242	63231	63231	One	330	” Cousin Georgiana had said solemnly , “
63251	63264	63231	63231	One	330	” Barney had asked Valancy what she wanted for a Christmas present . “
63270	63481	63231	63231	One	330	” said Valancy , who had got a pair of goloshes last Christmas and two long - sleeved , woolen undervests the year before . And so on back . To her delight , Barney gave her a necklace of pearl beads . Valancy had wanted a string of milky pearl beads — like congealed moonshine — all her life . And these were so pretty . All that worried her was that they were really too good . They must have cost a great deal — fifteen dollars , at least . Could Barney afford that ? She did n’t know a thing about his finances . She had refused to let him buy any of her clothes — she had enough for that , she told him , as long as she would need clothes . In a round , black jar on the chimney - piece Barney put money for their household expenses — always enough . The jar was never empty , though Valancy never caught him replenishing it . He could n’t have much , of course , and that necklace — but Valancy tossed care aside . She would wear it and enjoy it . It was the first pretty thing she had ever had .
63583	63592	63594	63594	Barney	132	“ But they ’ll come back in spring , ”
63743	63770	63772	63772	Barney	132	“ A plate of apples , an open fire , and ‘ a jolly goode booke whereon to looke ’ are a fair substitute for heaven , ”
63774	63792	63772	63772	Barney	132	“ Any one can have the streets of gold . Let ’s have another whack at Carman . ”
64341	64345	64346	64346	Barney	132	“ Youdolaugh beautifully , ”
64351	64403	64346	64346	Barney	132	“ It makes me want to laugh just to hear you laugh . There ’s a trick about your laugh — as if there were so much more fun back of it that you would n’t let out . Did you laugh like that before you came to Mistawis , Moonlight ? ”
64404	64434	64450	64450	he	1642	“ I never laughed at all — really . I used to giggle foolishly when I felt I was expected to . But now — the laugh just comes . ”
65019	65028	65029	65029	she	83	“ Barney , I thought you were dead , ”
65035	65102	65032	65032	Barney	132	“ After two years of the Klondike did you think a baby storm like this could get me ? I spent the night in that old lumber shanty over by Muskoka . A bit cold but snug enough . Little goose ! Your eyes look like burnt holes in a blanket . Did you sit up here all night worrying over an old woodsman like me ? ”
65103	65106	65108	65108	Valancy	83	“ Yes , ”
65110	65177	65108	65108	Valancy	83	“ I — couldn’t help it . The storm seemed so wild . Anybody might have been lost in it . When — I saw you — come round the point — there — something happened to me . I do n’t know what . It was as if I had died and come back to life . I ca n’t describe it any other way . ”
65324	65343	65345	65345	Valancy	83	“ Think how many thousands of springs have been here on Mistawis — and all of them beautiful , ”
65347	65399	65345	65345	Valancy	83	“ Oh , Barney , look at that wild plum ! I will — I must quote from John Foster . There ’s a passage in one of his books — I’ve re - read it a hundred times . He must have written it before a tree just like that : “
65534	65535	65536	65536	I	0	” “
65553	65558	65536	65536	I	0	” said Barney heartlessly . “
65566	65572	65536	65536	I	0	” said Valancy , unsubdued . “
65621	65622	65605	65605	They	1675	” “
65631	65635	65605	65605	They	1675	” said Barney . “
65693	65694	65697	65698	John Fosterish	285	” “
65700	65704	65697	65698	John Fosterish	285	” teased Valancy . “
65716	66012	65707	65707	I	0	” complained Barney . One of the earliest signs of spring was the renaissance of Lady Jane . Barney put her on roads that no other car would look at , and they went through Deerwood in mud to the axles . They passed several Stirlings , who groaned and reflected that now spring was come they would encounter that shameless pair everywhere . Valancy , prowling about Deerwood shops , met Uncle Benjamin on the street ; but he did not realise until he had gone two blocks further on that the girl in the scarlet - collared blanket coat , with cheeks reddened in the sharp April air and the fringe of black hair over laughing , slanted eyes , was Valancy . When he did realise it , Uncle Benjamin was indignant . What business had Valancy to look like — like — like a young girl ? The way of the transgressor was hard . Had to be . Scriptural and proper . Yet Valancy ’s path could n’t be hard . She would n’t look like that if it were . There was something wrong . It was almost enough to make a man turn modernist . Barney and Valancy clanged on to the Port , so that it was dark when they went through Deerwood again . At her old home Valancy , seized with a sudden impulse , got out , opened the little gate and tiptoed around to the sitting - room window . There sat her mother and Cousin Stickles drearily , grimly knitting . Baffling and inhuman as ever . If they had looked the least bit lonesome Valancy would have gone in . But they did not . Valancy would not disturb them for worlds .
66235	66242	66244	66244	Barney	132	“ I ’ve had a caller , ”
66258	66261	66262	66262	Valancy	83	“ Who ? ”
66276	66288	66268	66268	She	83	“ Allan Tierney . He wants to paint you , Moonlight . ”
66289	66292	66293	66293	Valancy	83	“ Me ! ”
66301	66310	66293	66293	Valancy	83	“ You ’re laughing at me , Barney . ”
66311	66343	66268	66268	She	83	“ I ’m not . That ’s what Tierney came for . To ask my permission to paint my wife — as the Spirit of Muskoka , or something like that . ”
66344	66349	66351	66351	Valancy	83	“ But — but — ”
66353	66365	66351	66351	Valancy	83	“ Allan Tierney never paints any but — any but — — ”
66366	66370	66372	66372	Barney	132	“ Beautiful women , ”
66374	66389	66372	66372	Barney	132	“ Conceded . Q. E. D. , Mistress Barney Snaith is a beautiful woman . ”
66390	66393	66395	66395	Valancy	83	“ Nonsense , ”
66403	66432	66395	66395	Valancy	83	“ Youknowthat ’s nonsense , Barney . I know I ’m a heap better - looking than I was a year ago , but I ’m not beautiful . ”
66433	66441	66443	66443	Barney	132	“ Allan Tierney never makes a mistake , ”
66445	66623	66443	66443	Barney	132	“ You forget , Moonlight , that there are different kinds of beauty . Your imagination is obsessed by the very obvious type of your cousin Olive . Oh , I ’ve seen her — she ’s a stunner — but you ’d never catch Allan Tierney wanting to paint her . In the horrible but expressive slang phrase , she keeps all her goods in the shop - window . But in your subconscious mind you have a conviction that nobody can be beautiful who does n’t look like Olive . Also , you remember your face as it was in the days when your soul was not allowed to shine through it . Tierney said something about the curve of your cheek as you looked back over your shoulder . You know I ’ve often told you it was distracting . And he ’s quite batty about your eyes . If I was n’t absolutely sure it was solely professional — he ’s really a crabbed old bachelor , you know — I’d be jealous . ”
66624	66635	66637	66637	Valancy	83	“ Well , I do n’t want to be painted , ”
66639	66647	66637	66637	Valancy	83	“ I hope you told him that . ”
66648	66744	66443	66443	Barney	132	“ I could n’t tell him that . I did n’t know whatyouwanted . But I told himIdidn’t want my wife painted — hung up in a salon for the mob to stare at . Belonging to another man . For of course I could n’t buy the picture . So even if you had wanted to be painted , Moonlight , your tyrannous husband would not have permitted it . Tierney was a bit squiffy . He is n’t used to being turned down like that . His requests are almost like royalty ’s . ”
66745	66751	66753	66753	Valancy	83	“ But we are outlaws , ”
66755	66767	66753	66753	Valancy	83	“ We bow to no decrees — we acknowledge no sovereignty . ”
66775	66805	66806	66806	Her	1689	“ I wish Olive could know that Allan Tierney wanted to paint me . Me ! Little - old - maid - Valancy - Stirling - that - was . ”
66949	66952	66957	66957	she	1689	“ passing away ”
67095	67101	67103	67103	Barney	132	“ You nice little thing , ”
67106	67132	67103	67103	Barney	132	“ Oh , you nice little thing ! Sometimes I feel you ’re too nice to be real — that I ’m just dreaming you . ”
67133	67151	67153	67153	Valancy	83	“ Why ca n’t I die now — this very minute — when I am so happy ! ”
67316	67330	67332	67332	Valancy	83	“ I ’m afraid heaven will be very dull after this past year , ”
67334	67390	67332	67332	Valancy	83	“ But perhaps one will not remember . Would that be — nice ? No , no . I do n’t want to forget Barney . I ’d rather be miserable in heaven remembering him than happy forgetting him . And I ’ll always remember through all eternity — that he really , reallyliked me . ”
67906	67911	67912	67912	she	83	“ Barney — Barney ! ”
67969	67982	67984	67984	Valancy	83	“ Go — go — quick — you’ll be killed , Barney ! ”
68063	68077	68085	68085	his	1719	“ Barney — go — go — for God ’s sake — go ! ”
68078	68081	68083	68083	Barney	132	“ Never ! ”
68142	68146	68147	68147	he	1719	“ Thank God ! ”
68587	68612	68574	68574	He	1737	“ I suppose we ’d better be hiking back . Sun ’s getting low . Are you good for the rest of the road ? ”
68613	68618	68620	68620	Valancy	83	“ I think so , ”
68856	68859	68881	68881	him	1737	“ Yes . ”
68860	68863	68864	68864	she	83	“ No , ”
69527	69534	69515	69516	Dr. Trent	85	“ Er — Miss — Miss — ”
69535	69539	69541	69541	Valancy	83	“ Mrs. Snaith , ”
69544	69572	69541	69541	Valancy	83	“ I was Miss Valancy Stirling when I came to you last May — over a year ago . I wanted to consult you about my heart . ”
69579	69680	69573	69574	Dr. Trent	85	“ Oh , of course . I remember now . I ’m really not to blame for not knowing you . You ’ve changed — splendidly . And married . Well , well , it has agreed with you . You do n’t look much like an invalid now , hey ? I remember that day . I was badly upset . Hearing about poor Ned bowled me over . But Ned ’s as good as new and you , too , evidently . I told you so , you know — told you there was nothing to worry over . ”
69686	69695	69696	69696	she	83	“ You told me , in your letter , ”
69714	69748	69696	69696	she	83	“ that I had angina pectoris — in the last stages — complicated with an aneurism . That I might die any minute — that I could n’t live longer than a year . ”
69755	69758	69759	69759	he	85	“ Impossible ! ”
69763	69772	69759	69759	he	85	“ I could n’t have told you that ! ”
69786	69791	69792	69792	he	85	“ Miss Valancy Stirling , ”
69795	69821	69792	69792	he	85	“ Yes — yes . Of course I wrote you — on the train — that night . But Itoldyou there was nothing serious — — ”
69822	69827	69829	69829	Valancy	83	“ Read your letter , ”
69864	69933	69852	69852	He	85	“ Good heavens ! This is the letter I meant for old Miss Jane Sterling . From Port Lawrence . She was here that day , too . I sent you the wrong letter . What unpardonable carelessness ! But I was beside myself that night . My God , and you believed that — you believed — but you didn’t — you went to another doctor — — ”
69950	69955	69956	69956	she	83	“ I believed it , ”
69960	69992	69956	69956	she	83	“ I did n’t go to any other doctor . I — I — it would take too long to explain . But I believed I was going to die soon . ”
69999	70025	69993	69994	Dr. Trent	85	“ I can never forgive myself . What a year you must have had ! But you do n’t look — I ca n’t understand ! ”
70026	70030	70032	70032	Valancy	83	“ Never mind , ”
70035	70047	70032	70032	Valancy	83	“ And so there ’s nothing the matter with my heart ? ”
70048	70091	69993	69994	Dr. Trent	85	“ Well , nothing serious . You had what is called pseudo - angina . It ’s never fatal — passes away completely with proper treatment . Or sometimes with a shock of joy . Have you been troubled much with it ? ”
70092	70099	70101	70101	Valancy	83	“ Not at all since March , ”
70128	70132	69993	69994	Dr. Trent	85	“ shock of joy ”
70136	70176	69993	69994	Dr. Trent	85	“ Then likely you ’re all right . I told you what to do in the letter you should have got . Andof course I supposed you ’d go to another doctor . Child , why did n’t you ? ”
70177	70186	70192	70193	Dr. Trent	85	“ I did n’t want anybody to know . ”
70187	70190	70192	70193	Dr. Trent	85	“ Idiot , ”
70196	70388	70192	70193	Dr. Trent	85	“ I ca n’t understand such folly . And poor old Miss Sterling . She must have got your letter — telling her there was nothing serious the matter . Well , well , it could n’t have made any difference . Her case was hopeless . Nothing that she could have done or left undone could have made any difference . I was surprised she lived as long as she did — two months . She was here that day — not long before you . I hated to tell her the truth . You think I ’m a blunt old curmudgeon — and my lettersareblunt enough . I ca n’t soften things . But I ’m a snivelling coward when it comes to telling a woman face to face that she ’s got to die soon . I told her I ’d look up some features of the case I was n’t quite sure of and let her know next day . But you got her letter — look here , ‘ Dear Miss S - t - e - r - l - i - n - g. ’ ”
70389	70415	70549	70549	she	83	“ Yes . I noticed that . But I thought it a mistake . I did n’t know there were any Sterlings in Port Lawrence . ”
70416	70513	70192	70193	Dr. Trent	85	“ She was the only one . A lonely old soul . Lived by herself with only a little home girl . She died two months after she was here — died in her sleep . My mistake could n’t have made any difference to her . But you ! I ca n’t forgive myself for inflicting a year ’s misery on you . It ’s time I retired , all right , when I do things like that — even if my son was supposed to be fatally injured . Can you ever forgive me ? ”
70712	70716	70704	70704	Snaith	132	“ up back ! ”
70922	70925	70956	70956	them	1792	“ up back ”
71435	71449	71419	71430	an unparalysed little imp at the back of Valancy ’s paralysed mind	1813	“ Such a face should have a fringe of white whisker around it . ”
71571	71600	71547	71547	he	1814	“ Can you tell me , Miss , if that house yonder belongs to a Mr. Redfern ? And if so , how can I get to it ? ”
71665	71668	71670	71670	Valancy	83	“ No , ”
71673	71683	71670	71670	Valancy	83	“ No — that house belongs to Mr. Snaith . ”
71688	71806	71684	71685	Dr. Redfern	112	“ Yes , I understand Bernie ’s been calling himself Snaith . Well , it ’s his middle name — was his poor mother ’s . Bernard Snaith Redfern — that ’s him . And now , Miss , you can tell me how to get over to that island ? Nobody seems to be home there . I ’ve done some waving and yelling . Henry , there , would n’t yell . He ’s a one - job man . But old Doc Redfern can yell with the best of them yet , and ai n’t above doing it . Raised nothing but a couple of crows . Guess Bernie ’s out for the day . ”
71807	71817	71819	71819	Valancy	83	“ He was away when I left this morning , ”
71821	71831	71832	71832	She	83	“ I suppose he has n’t come home yet . ”
71879	71887	71867	71870	the aforesaid little imp	1815	“ It never rains but it pours . ”
71910	71924	71925	71925	He	112	“ When you left this morning ? Do you live — over there ? ”
71934	71938	71940	71940	Valancy	83	“ Of course , ”
71943	71949	71940	71940	Valancy	83	“ I ’m his wife . ”
71978	72000	71973	71975	Valancy ’s imp	1817	“ Why be bald ? Why lose your manly beauty ? Try Redfern ’s Hair Vigor . It keeps you young . ”
72001	72005	72007	72008	Dr. Redfern	112	“ Excuse me , ”
72010	72019	72007	72008	Dr. Redfern	112	“ This is a bit of a shock . ”
72020	72031	72032	72033	The imp	1818	“ Shocks seem to be in the air this morning . ”
72044	72067	72032	72033	The imp	1818	“ I did n’t know Bernie was — married . I did n’t think hewouldhave got married without telling his old dad . ”
72096	72102	72103	72103	she	83	“ Do n’t blame him , ”
72107	72123	72103	72103	she	83	“ It — it was n’t his fault . It — was all my doing . ”
72124	72137	72139	72140	Dr. Redfern	112	“ You did n’t ask him to marry you , I suppose , ”
72142	72257	72139	72140	Dr. Redfern	112	“ He might have let me know . I ’d have got acquainted with my daughter - in - law before this if he had . But I ’m glad to meet you now , my dear — very glad . You look like a sensible young woman . I used to sorter fear Barney’d pick out some pretty bit of fluff just because she was good - looking . They were all after him , of course . Wanted his money ? Eh ? Did n’t like the pills and the bitters but liked the dollars . Eh ? Wanted to dip their pretty little fingers in old Doc ’s millions . Eh ? ”
72258	72261	72263	72263	Valancy	83	“ Millions ! ”
72305	72308	72310	72311	Dr. Redfern	112	“ Millions , ”
72314	72323	72310	72311	Dr. Redfern	112	“ And Bernie chucks them for — that . ”
72335	72414	72325	72325	he	112	“ Would n’t you think he ’d have more sense ? And all on account of a white bit of a girl . He must have got overthatfeeling , anyhow , since he ’s married . You must persuade him to come back to civilisation . All nonsense wasting his life like this . Ai n’t you going to take me over to your house , my dear ? I suppose you ’ve some way of getting there . ”
72415	72419	72421	72421	Valancy	83	“ Of course , ”
72441	72453	72424	72424	She	83	“ Does your — your man want to come , too ? ”
72454	72506	72325	72325	he	112	“ Who ? Henry . Not he . Look at him sitting there disapproving . Disapproves of the whole expedition . The trail up from the road nearly gave him a conniption . Well , itwasa devilish road to put a car on . Whose old bus is that up there ? ”
72507	72511	72325	72325	he	112	“ Barney ’s . ”
72512	72542	72424	72424	She	83	“ Good Lord ! Does Bernie Redfern ride in a thing like that ? It looks like the great - great - grand - mother of all the Fords . ”
72543	72556	72558	72558	Valancy	83	“ It is n’t a Ford . It ’s a Grey Slosson , ”
72716	72739	72700	72701	The doctor	2143	“ Warm , eh ? Lord , what a view ! Wonder if it would soften Henry if he could see it . ”
72740	72746	72748	72748	Valancy	83	“ Have you had dinner ? ”
72750	72850	72851	72851	Valancy	83	“ Yes , my dear — had it before we left Port Lawrence . Did n’t know what sort of wild hermit ’s hollow we were coming to , you see . Had n’t any idea I was going to find a nice little daughter - in - law here all ready to toss me up a meal . Cats , eh ? Puss , puss ! See that . Cats love me . Bernie was always fond of cats ! It ’s about the only thing he took from me . He ’s his poor mother ’s boy . ”
72881	72939	72872	72873	Dr. Redfern	112	“ Sit down , dear . Never stand when you can sit . I want to get a good look at Barney ’s wife . Well , well , I like your face . No beauty — you do n’t mind my saying that — you’ve sense enough to know it , I reckon . Sit down . ”
73001	73011	72990	72991	Dr. Redfern	112	“ When do you think Bernie will be back ? ”
73012	73023	72990	72991	Dr. Redfern	112	“ I do n’t know — not before night probably . ”
73024	73030	72990	72991	Dr. Redfern	112	“ Where did he go ? ”
73031	73047	72990	72991	Dr. Redfern	112	“ I do n’t know that either . Likely to the woods — up back . ”
73048	73112	72990	72991	Dr. Redfern	112	“ So he does n’t tell you his comings and goings , either ? Bernie was always a secretive young devil . Never understood him . Just like his poor mother . But I thought a lot of him . It hurt me when he disappeared as he did . Eleven years ago . I have n’t seen my boy for eleven years . ”
73113	73117	73118	73118	Valancy	83	“ Eleven years . ”
73122	73132	73118	73118	Valancy	83	“ It ’s only six since he came here . ”
73133	73190	73118	73118	Valancy	83	“ Oh , he was in the Klondike before that — and all over the world . He used to drop me a line now and then — never give any clue to where he was but just a line to say he was all right . I s’pose he ’s told you all about it . ”
73191	73202	73204	73204	Valancy	83	“ No . I know nothing of his past life , ”
73262	73279	73627	73627	Mistawis	22	“ What happened ? Why did he leave his home ? Tell me . Tell me . ”
73280	73609	73646	73646	she	83	“ Well , it ai n’t much of a story . Just a young fool gone mad because of a quarrel with his girl . Only Bernie was a stubborn fool . Always stubborn . You never could make that boy do anything he did n’t want to do . From the day he was born . Yet he was always a quiet , gentle little chap , too . Good as gold . His poor mother died when he was only two years old . I ’d just begun to make money with my Hair Vigor . I ’d dreamed the formula for it , you see . Some dream that . The cash rolled in . Bernie had everything he wanted . I sent him to the best schools — private schools . I meant to make a gentleman of him . Never had any chance myself . Meant he should have every chance . He went through McGill . Got honours and all that . I wanted him to go in for law . He hankered after journalism and stuff like that . Wanted me to buy a paper for him — or back him in publishing what he called a ‘ real , worthwhile , honest - to - goodness Canadian Magazine . ’ I s’pose I ’d have done it — I always did what he wanted me to do . Was n’t he all I had to live for ? I wanted him to be happy . And he never was happy . Can you believe it ? Not that he said so . But I ’d always a feeling that he was n’t happy . Everything he wanted — all the money he could spend — his own bank account — travel — seeing the world — but he was n’t happy . Not till he fell in love with Ethel Traverse . Then he was happy for a little while . ”
73642	73645	73646	73646	she	83	“ Yes , ”
73663	73672	73646	73646	she	83	“ What — was — she — like ? ”
73673	73679	73681	73682	Dr. Redfern	112	“ Prettiest girl in Montreal , ”
73684	73784	73681	73682	Dr. Redfern	112	“ Oh , she was a looker , all right . Eh ? Gold hair — shiny as silk — great , big , soft , black eyes — skin like milk and roses . Do n’t wonder Bernie fell for her . And brains as well . Shewasn’t a bit of fluff . B. A. from McGill . A thoroughbred , too . One of the best families . But a bit lean in the purse . Eh ! Bernie was mad about her . Happiest young fool you ever saw . Then — the bust - up . ”
73785	73789	73790	73790	Valancy	83	“ What happened ? ”
73904	74059	73894	73894	She	83	“ Blest if I know , my dear . Some fool quarrel , I suppose . Bernie just lit out — disappeared . He wrote me from the Yukon . Said his engagement was broken and he was n’t coming back . And not to try to hunt him up because he was never coming back . I did n’t . What was the use ? I knew Bernie . I went on piling , up money because there was n’t anything else to do . But I was mighty lonely . All I lived for was them little notes now and then from Bernie — Klondike — England — South Africa — China — everywhere . I thought maybe he ’d come back some day to his lonesome old dad . Then six years ago even the letters stopped . I did n’t hear a word of or from him till last Christmas . ”
74060	74065	74153	74153	herself	83	“ Did he write ? ”
74066	74145	74153	74153	herself	83	“ No . But he drew a check for fifteen thousand dollars on his bank account . The bank manager is a friend of mine — one of my biggest shareholders . He ’d always promised me he ’d let me know if Bernie drew any checks . Bernie had fifty thousand there . And he ’d never touched a cent of it till last Christmas . The check was made out to Aynsley ’s , Toronto — — ”
74146	74150	74153	74153	herself	83	“ Aynsley ’s ? ”
74172	74369	74158	74158	She	83	“ Yes . The big jewellery house there . After I ’d thought it over a while , I got brisk . I wanted to locate Bernie . Had a special reason for it . It was time he gave up his fool hoboing and come to his senses . Drawing that fifteen told me there was something in the wind . The manager communicated with the Aynsleys — his wife was an Aynsley — and found out that Bernard Redfern had bought a pearl necklace there . His address was given as Box 444 , Port Lawrence , Muskoka , Ont . First I thought I ’d write . Then I thought I ’d wait till the open season for cars and come down myself . Ai n’t no hand at writing . I ’ve motored from Montreal . Got to Port Lawrence yesterday . Enquired at the post - office . Told me they knew nothing of any Bernard Snaith Redfern , but there was a Barney Snaith had a P. O. box there . Lived on an island out here , they said . So here I am . And where ’s Barney ? ”
74413	74423	74405	74405	she	83	“ Excuse me . It ’s so — amusing , ”
74428	74433	74435	74436	Dr. Redfern	112	“ Is n’t it ? ”
74447	74517	74435	74436	Dr. Redfern	112	“ Now , you seem like a sensible young woman , and I dare say you ’ve lots of influence over Bernie . Ca n’t you get him to come back to civilisation and live like other people ? I ’ve a house up there . Big as a castle . Furnished like a palace . I want company in it — Bernie ’s wife — Bernie ’s children . ”
74518	74525	74527	74527	Valancy	83	“ Did Ethel Traverse ever marry ? ”
74530	74619	74527	74527	Valancy	83	“ Bless you , yes . Two years after Bernie levanted . But she ’s a widow now . Pretty as ever . To be frank , that was my special reason for wanting to find Bernie . I thought they ’d make it up , maybe . But , of course , that ’s all off now . Does n’t matter . Bernie ’s choice of a wife is good enough for me . It ’s my boy I want . Think he ’ll soon be back ? ”
74620	74663	74667	74667	his	112	“ I do n’t know . But I do n’t think he ’ll come before night . Quite late , perhaps . And perhaps not till tomorrow . But I can put you up comfortably . He ’ll certainly be back tomorrow . ”
74670	74682	74667	74667	his	112	“ Too damp . I ’ll take no chances with rheumatism . ”
74683	74697	74527	74527	Valancy	83	“ Why suffer that ceaseless anguish ? Why not try Redfern ’s Liniment ? ”
74709	74747	74748	74748	He	112	“ I must get back to Port Lawrence before rain starts . Henry goes quite mad when he gets mud on the car . But I ’ll come back tomorrow . Meanwhile you talk Bernie into reason . ”
74977	74982	74983	74983	she	83	“ At any rate , ”
74987	75005	74983	74983	she	83	“ Barney is n’t poor . He will be able to afford a divorce . Quite nicely . ”

75723	75889	75711	75711	She	83	“ Dear Barney : — I went to Dr. Trent this morning and found out he had sent me the wrong letter by mistake . There never was anything serious the matter with my heart and I am quite well now . I did not mean to trick you . Please believe that . I could not bear it if you did not believe that . I am very sorry for the mistake . But surely you can get a divorce if I leave you . Is desertion a ground for divorce in Canada ? Of course if there is anything I can do to help or hasten it I will do it gladly , if your lawyer will let me know . I thank you for all your kindness to me . I shall never forget it . Think as kindly of me as you can , because I did not mean to trap you . Good - bye . Yours gratefully , VALANCY . ”
75939	75973	75936	75936	she	1867	“ Your father was here today . He is coming back tomorrow . He told me everything . I think you should go back to him . He is very lonely for you . ”
75983	75985	75936	75936	she	1867	“ Barney ”

76781	76787	76778	76779	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ May I ask why ? ”
76788	76799	76801	76801	Valancy	83	“ Because — I’m — not — going to die , ”

76815	76824	76812	76813	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Who said you were going to die ? ”
76825	76829	76831	76832	Cousin Stickles	89	“ I suppose , ”
76842	76861	76812	76813	Uncle Benjamin	100	either—“I suppose you ’ve found out he has another wife — as we ’ve been sure all along . ”
76862	76871	76873	76873	Valancy	83	“ No . I only wish he had , ”
76961	76976	76978	76979	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ My home , as I told you , is always open to you , ”
76982	76990	76978	76979	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ but I can never forgive you . ”
76997	77012	77013	77013	she	83	“ I ’d care very little for that if I could only forgive myself , ”
77016	77021	77023	77024	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Come , come , ”
77042	77075	77034	77034	he	100	“ We ’ve had enough of mystery . What has happened ? Why have you left that fellow ? No doubt there ’s reason enough — but what particular reason is it ? ”
77090	77175	77082	77082	She	83	“ A year ago Dr. Trent told me I had angina pectoris and could not live long . I wanted to have some — life — before I died . That ’s why I went away . Why I married Barney . And now I ’ve found it is all a mistake . There is nothing wrong with my heart . I ’ve got to live — and Barney only married me out of pity . So I have to leave him — free . ”
77176	77181	77183	77184	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ God bless me ! ”
77192	77207	77186	77187	Cousin Stickles	89	“ Valancy , if you ’d only had confidence in your own mother — — ”
77208	77216	77218	77218	Valancy	83	“ Yes , yes , I know , ”
77221	77280	77218	77218	Valancy	83	“ What ’s the use of going into that now ? I ca n’t undo this year . God knows I wish I could . I ’ve tricked Barney into marrying me — and he ’s really Bernard Redfern . Dr. Redfern ’s son , of Montreal . And his father wants him to go back to him . ”
77319	77329	77330	77330	she	91	“ Dr. Redfern — not the Purple Pill man ? ”
77336	77351	77333	77333	Valancy	83	“ He ’s John Foster , too — the writer of those nature books . ”
77352	77357	77358	77359	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ But — but — ”

77409	77465	77406	77406	Valancy	83	“ Yes . Barney left home years ago — because of — of some trouble — some — disappointment . Now he will likely go back . So you see — I had to come home . He does n’t love me . I ca n’t hold him to a bond he was tricked into . ”
77472	77487	77466	77467	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Did he say so ? Does he want to get rid of you ? ”
77488	77532	77533	77534	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ No . I have n’t seen him since I found out . But I tell you — he only married me out of pity — because I asked him to — because he thought it would only be for a little while . ”
77555	77559	77544	77545	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Letmehandle this , ”
77570	77624	77544	77545	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Well , well , dear , we ’ll talk it all over later . You see , we do n’t quite understand everything yet . As Cousin Stickles says , you should have confided in us before . Later on — I dare say we can find a way out of this . ”
77625	77639	77641	77641	Valancy	83	“ You think Barney can easily get a divorce , do n’t you ? ”
77664	77697	77544	77545	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Trust to me , Valancy . Everything will arrange itself . Tell me this , Dossie . Have you been happy up back ? Was Sr.—Mr . Redfern good to you ? ”
77698	77712	77714	77714	Valancy	83	“ I have been very happy and Barney was very good to me , ”
77746	77749	77544	77545	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ I have been”—it
77757	77766	77544	77545	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Then do n’t worry , little girl . ”
77774	77790	77544	77545	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Your family will stand behind you . We ’ll see what can be done . ”
77791	77795	77797	77797	Valancy	83	“ Thank you , ”
77810	77827	77807	77808	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Can I go and lie down a little while ? I’m — I’m — tired . ”
77828	77835	77544	77545	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Of course you ’re tired . ”
77846	77879	77880	77880	He	100	“ All worn out and nervous . Go and lie down , by all means . You ’ll see things in quite a different light after you ’ve had a good sleep . ”
77893	77906	77890	77890	he	100	“ What is the best way to keep a man ’s love ? ”
77925	77928	77929	77929	she	83	“ What ? ”
77937	77943	77945	77946	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Not to return it , ”
77968	77973	77974	77974	he	100	“ Poor little Doss ! ”
77978	77995	77997	77998	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Do you really suppose that — Snaith — can actually be Dr. Redfern ’s son ? ”
78000	78077	77997	77998	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ I see no reason for doubting it . She says Dr. Redfern has been there . Why , the man is rich as wedding - cake . Amelia , I ’ve always believed there was more in Doss than most people thought . You kept her down too much — repressed her . She never had a chance to show what was in her . And now she ’s landed a millionaire for a husband . ”
78078	78081	78083	78084	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ But — ”
78086	78098	78083	78084	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ he — he — they told terrible tales about him . ”
78099	78201	77997	77998	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ All gossip and invention — all gossip and invention . It ’s always been a mystery to me why people should be so ready to invent and circulate slanders about other people they know absolutely nothing about . I ca n’t understand why you paid so much attention to gossip and surmise . Just because he did n’t choose to mix up with everybody , people resented it . I was surprised to find what a decent fellow he seemed to be that time he came into my store with Valancy . I discounted all the yarns then and there . ”
78202	78214	78216	78217	Cousin Stickles	89	“ But he was seen dead drunk in Port Lawrence once , ”
78233	78238	78240	78241	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Who saw him ? ”
78244	78306	78240	78241	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Who saw him ? Old Jemmy Strangsaidhe saw him . I would n’t take old Jemmy Strang ’s word on oath . He ’s too drunk himself half the time to see straight . He said he saw him lying drunk on a bench in the Park . Pshaw ! Redfern ’s been asleep there . Do n’t worry overthat . ”
78307	78318	78320	78321	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ But his clothes — and that awful old car — ”
78324	78329	78331	78332	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Eccentricities of genius , ”
78334	78376	78331	78332	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ You heard Doss say he was John Foster . I ’m not up in literature myself , but I heard a lecturer from Toronto say that John Foster ’s books had put Canada on the literary map of the world . ”
78377	78387	78389	78390	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ I — suppose — we must forgive her , ”
78392	78396	78397	78398	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Forgive her ! ”
78424	78445	78412	78413	poor Doss	98	“ Well , yes , I think you ’d better forgive her ! The question is — will Snaith forgiveus ! ”
78446	78465	78467	78468	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ What if she persists in leaving him ? You ’ve no idea how stubborn she can be , ”
78470	78706	78467	78468	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Leave it all to me , Amelia . Leave it all to me . You women have muddled it enough . This whole affair has been bungled from start to finish . If you had put yourself to a little trouble years ago , Amelia , she would not have bolted over the traces as she did . Just let her alone — don’t worry her with advice or questions till she ’s ready to talk . She ’s evidently run away in a panic because she ’s afraid he ’d be angry with her for fooling him . Most extraordinary thing of Trent to tell her such a yarn ! That ’s what comes of going to strange doctors . Well , well , we must n’t blame her too harshly , poor child . Redfern will come after her . If he does n’t , I ’ll hunt him up and talk to him as man to man . He may be a millionaire , but Valancy is a Stirling . He ca n’t repudiate her just because she was mistaken about her heart disease . Not likely he ’ll want to . Doss is a little overstrung . Bless me , I must get in the habit of calling her Valancy . She is n’t a baby any longer . Now , remember , Amelia . Be very kind and sympathetic . ”
79182	79199	79175	79175	She	83	“ Let me remember every one , God ! Let me never forget one of them ! ”
79314	79319	79310	79310	Barney	132	“ I love you , ”
79330	79334	79327	79327	Barney	132	“ I love you ”

79795	79826	79790	79791	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Mr. Redfern , I believe ? Very glad to meet you , sir . Yes , that naughty little girl of yours is here . We have been — — ”
79827	79833	79834	79834	Barney	132	“ I must see her , ”
79841	79860	79861	79861	He	100	“ Certainly , Mr. Redfern . Just step in here . Valancy will be down in a minute . ”
79879	79894	79869	79869	himself	100	“ Go up and tell Valancy to come down . Her husband is here . ”
79933	79937	79939	79940	Mrs. Frederick	91	“ Valancy dear , ”

79973	80001	79970	79970	her	83	“ I can not see him — I can not ! Tell him to go away — askhim to go away . I ca n’t see him ! ”
80002	80006	80008	80009	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Tell her , ”
80014	80027	80008	80009	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ that Redfern says he wo n’t go away until hehasseen her . ”

80123	80129	80131	80132	Uncle Benjamin	100	“ Because women need them , ”
80193	80283	80181	80181	Barney	132	“ Valancy , darling — oh , you darling little idiot ! Whatever possessed you to run away like that ? When I came home last night and found your letter I went quite mad . It was twelve o’clock — I knew it was too late to come here then . I walked the floor all night . Then this morning Dad came — I could n’t get away till now . Valancy , whatever got into you ? Divorce , forsooth ! Do n’t you know — — ”
80284	80295	80297	80297	Valancy	83	“ I know you only married me out of pity , ”
80304	80317	80297	80297	Valancy	83	“ I know you do n’t love me — I know — — ”
80318	80330	80332	80332	Barney	132	“ You ’ve been lying awake at three o’clock too long , ”
80337	80380	80332	80332	Barney	132	“ That ’s all that ’s the matter with you . Love you ! Oh , do n’t I love you ! My girl , when I saw that train coming down on you I knew whether I loved you or not ! ”
80381	80397	80399	80399	Valancy	83	“ Oh , I was afraid you would try to make me think you cared , ”
80402	80439	80440	80440	Barney	132	“ Don’t — don’t ! Iknow . I know all about Ethel Traverse — your father told me everything . Oh , Barney , do n’t torture me ! I can never go back to you ! ”
80467	80470	80471	80471	he	1949	“ Valancy , ”
80475	80497	80471	80471	he	1949	“ Father could n’t have told you everything because he did n’t know it . Will you letmetell you — everything ? ”
80498	80501	80503	80503	Valancy	83	“ Yes , ”
80643	80676	80634	80634	she	83	“ You ’ve seen Dad and you know I ’m Bernard Redfern . And I suppose you ’ve guessed that I ’m John Foster — since you went into Bluebeard ’s Chamber . ”
80677	80705	80634	80634	she	83	“ Yes . But I did n’t go in out of curiosity . I forgot you had told me not to go in — I forgot — — ”
80706	80793	80794	80794	Barney	132	“ Never mind . I ’m not going to kill you and hang you up on the wall , so there ’s no need to call for Sister Anne . I ’m only going to tell you my story from the beginning . I came back last night intending to do it . Yes , I ’m ‘ old Doc . Redfern ’s son’—of Purple Pills and Bitters fame . Oh , do n’t I know it ? Was n’t it rubbed into me for years ? ”
80843	81210	80836	80836	himself	132	“ Yes . As long as I can remember I ’ve been a millionaire ’s son . But when I was born Dad was n’t a millionaire . He was n’t even a doctor — isn’t yet . He was a veterinary and a failure at it . He and Mother lived in a little village up in Quebec and were abominably poor . I do n’t remember Mother . Have n’t even a picture of her . She died when I was two years old . She was fifteen years younger than Father — a little school teacher . When she died Dad moved into Montreal and formed a company to sell his hair tonic . He ’d dreamed the prescription one night , it seems . Well , it caught on . Money began to flow in . Dad invented — or dreamed — the other things , too — Pills , Bitters , Liniment and so on . He was a millionaire by the time I was ten , with a house so big a small chap like myself always felt lost in it . I had every toy a boy could wish for — and I was the loneliest little devil in the world . I remember only one happy day in my childhood , Valancy . Only one . Even you were better off than that . Dad had gone out to see an old friend in the country and took me along . I was turned loose in the barnyard and I spent the whole day hammering nails in a block of wood . I had a glorious day . When I had to go back to my roomful of playthings in the big house in Montreal I cried . But I did n’t tell Dad why . I never told him anything . It ’s always been a hard thing for me to tell things , Valancy — anything that went deep . And most things went deep with me . I was a sensitive child and I was even more sensitive as a boy . No one ever knew what I suffered . Dad never dreamed of it . “
81256	81259	81252	81252	I	0	then”—Barney clinched his fists—“I
81292	81297	81298	81298	They	1956	” Barney smiled grimly . “
81563	81564	81550	81550	McGill	304	” “
81571	81580	81568	81568	you	0	” Valancy ’s dull eyes flamed with indignation . “
81710	81734	81707	81708	Ethel Traverse	303	” Valancy shivered . Barney , his hands stuck in his pockets , was regarding the floor moodily and did n’t notice it . “
81881	81932	81857	81861	A girl friend of hers	1976	“ ‘ His money will gild the Pills and sweeten the Bitters , ’ said Ethel , with a laugh . ‘ Mother told me to catch him if I could . We ’re on the rocks . But pah ! I smell turpentine whenever he comes near me . ’ ”
81933	81938	81940	81940	Valancy	83	“ Oh , Barney ! ”
81971	81972	81969	81969	she	83	“ Well,”—Barney
81980	82230	82233	82233	you	1978	room—“that finished me . Completely . I left civilisation and those accursed dopes behind me and went to the Yukon . For five years I knocked about the world — in all sorts of outlandish places . I earned enough to live on — I would n’t touch a cent of Dad ’s money . Then one day I woke up to the fact that I no longer cared a hang about Ethel , one way or another . She was somebody I ’d known in another world — that was all . But I had no hankering to go back to the old life . None of that for me . I was free and I meant to keep so . I came to Mistawis — saw Tom MacMurray ’s island . My first book had been published the year before , and made a hit — I had a bit of money from my royalties . I bought my island . But I kept away from people . I had no faith in anybody . I did n’t believe there was such a thing as real friendship or true love in the world — not for me , anyhow — the son of Purple Pills . I used to revel in all the wild yarns they told of me . In fact , I ’m afraid I suggested a few of them myself . By mysterious remarks which people interpreted in the light of their own prepossessions . “
82429	82697	82699	82699	she	1993	“ But I did n’t realise what you actually meant to me till that moment at the switch . Then it came like a lightning flash . I knew I could n’t live without you — that if I could n’t pull you loose in time I ’d have to die with you . I admit it bowled me over — knocked me silly . I could n’t get my bearings for a while . That ’s why I acted like a mule . But the thought that drove me to the tall timber was the awful one that you were going to die . I ’d always hated the thought of it — but I supposed there was n’t any chance for you , so I put it out of my mind . Now I had to face it — you were under sentence of death and I could n’t live without you . When I came home last night I had made up my mind that I ’d take you to all the specialists in the world — that something surely could be done for you . I felt sure you could n’t be as bad as Dr. Trent thought , when those moments on the track had n’t even hurt you . And I found your note — and went mad with happiness — and a little terror for fear you did n’t care much for me , after all , and had gone away to get rid of me . But now , it ’s all right , is n’t it , darling ? ”
82704	82706	82699	82699	she	1993	“ darling ”
82708	82715	82716	82716	she	1993	“ Ican’tbelieve you care for me , ”
82720	82775	82776	82776	She	1993	“ Iknowyou ca n’t . What ’s the use , Barney ? Of course , you ’re sorry for me — of course you want to do the best you can to straighten out the mess . But it ca n’t be straightened out that way . You could n’t love me — me . ”
82834	82918	82823	82823	he	1994	“ Love you ! Girl , you ’re in the very core of my heart . I hold you there like a jewel . Did n’t I promise you I ’d never tell you a lie ? Love you ! I love you with all there is of me to love . Heart , soul , brain . Every fibre of body and spirit thrilling to the sweetness of you . There ’s nobody in the world for me but you , Valancy . ”
82919	82928	82930	82930	Valancy	83	“ You’re — a good actor , Barney , ”
82943	82953	82938	82938	Barney	132	“ So you do n’t believe me — yet ? ”
82954	82959	82823	82823	he	1994	“ I — can t. ”
82960	82965	82967	82967	Barney	132	“ Oh — damn ! ”
82995	83004	83006	83006	Barney	132	“ You do n’t want to believe it , ”
83017	83120	83006	83006	Barney	132	“ You ’re tired of me . You want to get out of it — free from me . You ’re ashamed of the Pills and the Liniment , just as she was . Your Stirling pride ca n’t stomach them . It was all right as long as you thought you had n’t long to live . A good lark — you could put up with me . But a lifetime with old Doc Redfern ’s son is a different thing . Oh , I understand — perfectly . I ’ve been very dense — but I understand , at last . ”
83138	83142	83143	83143	she	83	“ You darling ! ”
83146	83169	83143	83143	she	83	“ You do mean it ! You do really love me ! You would n’t be so enraged if you did n’t . ”
83221	83227	83228	83228	he	100	“ Everything is all right , ”
83289	83292	83271	83271	her	91	“ Marriages . ”
83293	83298	83300	83300	Valancy	83	“ But , Barney , ”
83306	83319	83300	83300	Valancy	83	“ your father — somehow — gave me to understand that youstilllovedher . ”
83320	83366	83271	83271	her	91	“ He would . Dad holds the championship for making blunders . If there ’s a thing that ’s better left unsaid you can trust him to say it . But he is n’t a bad old soul , Valancy . You ’ll like him . ”
83367	83373	83271	83271	her	91	“ I do , now . ”
83374	83410	83300	83300	Valancy	83	“ And his money is n’t tainted money . He made it honestly . His medicines are quite harmless . Even his Purple Pills do people whole heaps of good when they believe in them . ”
83411	83421	83423	83423	Valancy	83	“ But — I’m not fit for your life , ”
83425	83440	83423	83423	Valancy	83	“ I ’m not — clever — or well - educated — or — — ”
83441	83494	83300	83300	Valancy	83	“ My life is in Mistawis — and all the wild places of the world . I ’m not going to ask you to live the life of a society woman . Of course , we must spend a bit of the time with Dad — he ’s lonely and old — — ”
83495	83505	83507	83507	Valancy	83	“ But not in that big house of his , ”
83509	83518	83507	83507	Valancy	83	“ I ca n’t live in a palace . ”
83519	83531	83533	83533	Barney	132	“ Ca n’t come down to that after your Blue Castle , ”
83535	83698	83533	83533	Barney	132	“ Do n’t worry , sweet . I could n’t live in that house myself . It has a white marble stairway with gilt bannisters and looks like a furniture shop with the labels off . Likewise it ’s the pride of Dad ’s heart . We ’ll get a little house somewhere outside of Montreal — in the real country — near enough to see Dad often . I think we ’ll build one for ourselves . A house you build for yourself is so much nicer than a hand - me - down . But we ’ll spend our summers in Mistawis . And our autumns travelling . I want you to see the Alhambra — it ’s the nearest thing to the Blue Castle of your dreams I can think of . And there ’s an old - world garden in Italy where I want to show you the moon rising over Rome through the dark cypress - trees . ”
83699	83712	83507	83507	Valancy	83	“ Will that be any lovelier than the moon rising over Mistawis ? ”
83713	83845	83533	83533	Barney	132	“ Not lovelier . But a different kind of loveliness . There are so many kinds of loveliness . Valancy , before this year you ’ve spent all your life in ugliness . You know nothing of the beauty of the world . We ’ll climb mountains — hunt for treasures in the bazaars of Samarcand — search out the magic of east and west — run hand in hand to the rim of the world . I want to show you it all — see it again through your eyes . Girl , there are a million things I want to show you — do with you — say to you . It will take a lifetime . And we must see about that picture by Tierney , after all . ”
83846	83854	83856	83856	Valancy	83	“ Will you promise me one thing ? ”
83859	83862	83864	83864	Barney	132	“ Anything , ”
83867	83898	83864	83864	Barney	132	“ Only one thing . You are never , under any circumstances or under any provocation , to cast it up to me that I asked you to marry me . ”
83912	83942	83908	83910	Mr. Cecil Bruce	323	“ It ’s really disgusting that Doss ’ crazy adventures should have turned out like this . It makes one feel that there is no use in behaving properly . “
84021	84052	84055	84055	he	2002	“ He ’s such an insignificent - looking creature . I mentioned this to Doss but all she said was , ‘ I do n’t like collar ad men . ’ “
84108	84133	84134	84136	Old Doc Redfern	299	“ He also claims , I believe , to be John Foster . We can believethator not , as we like , I suppose . “
84197	84218	84219	84220	Uncle Ben	100	“ Well , I think I ’ll run away , too , and disgrace myself . It seems to pay . “
84295	84295	84292	84292	her	83	”
84417	84441	84412	84412	Valancy	83	“ Do n’t cry , Moonlight . We ’ll be back next summer . And now we ’re off for a real honeymoon . ”
